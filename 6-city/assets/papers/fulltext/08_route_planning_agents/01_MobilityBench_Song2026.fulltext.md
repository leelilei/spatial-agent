1 Introduction
The advance of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the
emergence of tool-augmented agents, which integrate natural language reasoning with executable actions via external APIs [21, 24].
By grounding user intent in programmatic interactions with realworld services, such agents substantially broaden the range of tasks
they can support, from simple information retrieval to complex
decision-making workflows, such as web navigation [18, 25], computer interaction [11, 17], and route planning [4, 36].
Among these agents, route-planning agents constitute a particularly challenging application domain, operating under diverse
and dynamic real-world constraints that shape everyday human
mobility [3, 5, 27]. Real-world mobility requests extend far beyond
simple point-to-point navigation [33], often involving multiple,
interacting constraints, such as user preferences (e.g., avoiding
highways or minimizing transfers), ordered waypoints, modalitydependent conditions, and time-sensitive requirements. Addressing

Conference acronym ’XX,

such demands requires agents to accurately interpret nuanced user
instructions, invoke appropriate travel-related APIs, and generate
executable itineraries with reliable cost estimates—including travel
time, distance, and transfer counts—capabilities that remain difficult
to evaluate systematically in realistic mobility settings.
Recent benchmarks for evaluating the planning capabilities of
LLMs and agents, such as TravelBench [5] and TravelPlanner [27],
primarily focus on high-level itinerary generation and abstract
constraint reasoning. As a result, they fall short of capturing the
complexity of route planning for everyday human mobility, which
requires fine-grained reasoning over large-scale, map-based environments and dynamically changing conditions. Meanwhile, systematically evaluating route-planning agents in real-world mobility
scenarios still faces several fundamental challenges: (1) scalable
scenario coverage, as evaluation must span route-planning problems of varying difficulty and combinations of constraints, ranging
from simple point-to-point queries to complex multi-constraint
requests; (2) non-determinism of live mapping APIs, whose responses vary over time due to traffic dynamics, service availability,
and backend updates [16, 29], thereby undermining reproducibility
and fair comparison; (3) comprehensive and reliable evaluation, as effective assessment requires integrating multiple objective
criteria beyond LLM-based subjective judging [37] to verify APIcall validity, constraint satisfaction, and factual grounding; and
(4) extensible and reproducible evaluation toolkit, as rapid
advances in LLM backbones and agent frameworks demand a lightweight, modular toolkit that supports easy deployment, scalable
data expansion, and consistent evaluation across settings.
To address these challenges, we introduce MobilityBench, a
scalable benchmark for evaluating route-planning agents in realworld mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from largescale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap, one of

the largest map and navigation service providers in China, and
is designed to reflect the diversity and complexity of everyday
mobility needs while removing all personally identifiable information. It covers a broad spectrum of real-world route-planning intents, including point-to-point routing, customized multi-waypoint
itineraries, and multimodal route planning that integrates driving,
walking, cycling, and public transit. In addition, MobilityBench
supports preference-aware navigation, such as avoiding highways
or minimizing transfers, as well as mobility-related information
access, including bus station details, bus line information, and road
congestion status. The benchmark spans queries from over 350
cities worldwide and is designed to be easily extensible, enabling
continuous expansion to new regions, scenarios, and intent types.
Given the inherent non-determinism and reproducibility challenges of live mapping services, MobilityBench is built around a
deterministic API-replay sandbox that enables reproducible, endto-end evaluation of route-planning agents. During dataset construction, responses fromrouting and points-of-interest APIs are
captured and cached through a standardized interface, effectively
freezing traffic conditions and service states at the time of collection. During evaluation, all API calls issued by an agent are intercepted and resolved against the cached response store, ensuring
that identical inputs consistently yield identical, verifiable outputs.
By eliminating uncontrolled environmental variance introduced
by live services, this sandbox-based design ensures that measured
performance faithfully reflects an agent’s reasoning and tool-use
capabilities rather than fluctuations in external systems.
We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol that
centers on outcome validity while providing complementary assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency.

2 Related Work
2.1 Route Planning in Urban Computing
Route planning is a long-standing problem in urban computing,
attracting sustained attention from both academia and industry
due to its central role in large-scale transportation systems and
location-based services. Early studies primarily focused on optimizing physical costs, such as distance or travel time, under a
graph-theoretic setting. Classical shortest-path algorithms, including Dijkstra [9] and A* [8, 10], were widely adopted to guarantee
optimality while improving scalability in real-world road networks.
These methods established the algorithmic foundations of modern navigation systems, but typically assume homogeneous objectives and well-defined cost functions. As mobility demands became
increasingly diverse, subsequent research moved beyond singleobjective optimization toward preference-aware route planning.
These approaches incorporate user interests and contextual factors by integrating routing with recommendation models, such
as INTSR [28]. Nevertheless, most existing methods rely on structured features or predefined preference spaces, which limit their
ability to accommodate long-tail, ambiguous, or weakly specified
requirements expressed in natural language. Recently, LLMs have
been explored as a new interface for route planning, owing to their
strong capability in understanding complex semantic instructions.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs alone are unreliable
for spatial reasoning and constrained optimization in geographic
settings [2, 12]. To mitigate these limitations, hybrid frameworks
have been proposed that couple LLMs with traditional planners,
using LLMs for high-level decision guidance [19, 35] or intent and
constraint extraction [34]. Further studies introduce hierarchical
planning architectures [36] and reinforcement learning–based optimization strategies [6, 7, 20, 23] to improve robustness under multiple objectives and constraints. In parallel, tool-augmented language
agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in interacting with
real-world systems and coordinating external tools for structured
decision-making, making them a promising paradigm for route
planning in real-world mobility scenarios. Existing travel planning
agents, however, mainly focus on high-level itinerary generation
and abstract constraint reasoning, without tightly integrating semantic intent understanding with low-level route optimization over
real road networks. As a result, they fall short of capturing the complexity of route planning required for everyday human mobility. In
this work, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility
scenarios, to advance research in this area.

2.2 Tool-augmented Agent Benchmark
Building on the emergence of tool-augmented agents enabled by
LLMs, recent work has focused on evaluating agents’ ability to
follow instructions and interact with external tools. For instance,
ToolBench [22] constructs a large-scale benchmark over real-world
APIs, requiring agents to perform sequential search and planning
to complete complex instructions. 𝜏-bench [30] further emphasizes
interactive evaluation by simulating user–agent interactions and
measuring behavioral consistency across repeated trials. In contrast
to these general-purpose evaluations, recent work in urban computing has proposed domain-specific benchmarks for agent evaluation.
TravelPlanner introduces a benchmark for multi-day itinerary construction by integrating domain-specific tools such as flight and
restaurant search, and evaluates agents under itinerary-level environmental, commonsense, and hard constraints [27]. TravelBench
further extends this task to multi-turn dialogue scenarios, enabling
the evaluation of agents’ ability to infer and refine users’ implicit
preferences through interaction [5]. Despite these advances, existing benchmarks primarily focus on high-level itinerary generation and abstract constraint satisfaction, and do not systematically
evaluate agents’ ability to perform fine-grained route planning under mobility-specific constraints, such as preference-aware routing
(e.g., avoiding highways or minimizing transfers), ordered waypoint
requirements, modality-dependent conditions, and time-sensitive
constraints. To address this gap, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based route-planning
agents in real-world mobility scenarios.
3 MobilityBench
MobilityBench is a scalable benchmark for evaluating route-planning
agents in real-world mobility scenarios. We first describe how the
benchmark is built from large-scale anonymized mobility queries
and organized into a comprehensive task taxonomy. We then introduce a structured ground-truth representation that explicitly
captures the minimal tool interactions and intermediate evidence
required to correctly resolve each request, serving as a stable and
interpretable reference for evaluation. To ensure reproducibility, all
tool interactions are executed within a deterministic replay sandbox.
Finally, we present a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol that
leverages this structured ground truth to assess agent performance.
3.1 Benchmark Construction
3.1.1 Episode-centric Formulation. To enable rigorous evaluation
of route-planning agents in realistic mobility scenarios, MobilityBench adopts an episode-centric formulation, in which each episode
encapsulates a self-contained mobility request solvable via tool
augmentation. Formally, an episode is represented as a four-tuple
𝑒 = (𝑥, 𝑧, S, 𝑦), where:
• 𝑥 denotes an anonymized natural-language user query;
• 𝑧 encodes contextual information associated with the request,
such as user location, city, and other background variables relevant to mobility decision-making;
• S denotes a fixed and replayable snapshot of relevant API responses provided by the replay sandbox (Section 3.1.4), enabling
consistent and deterministic evaluation across agent runs; and

• 𝑦 denotes a structured ground-truth annotation constructed (Section 3.1.3) and used exclusively to support the automated evaluation protocol (Section 3.2). It is never exposed to the agent and
serves solely for evaluation and diagnostic analysis.
Throughout this work, the route-planning agents are not permitted
to ask users for clarification. Consequently, all episodes are designed
to be fully solvable based solely on the initial user query 𝑥.
3.1.2 Data Collection and Task Taxonomy Construction. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized mobility queries
collected from AMap over the past six months. In real-world on-thego scenarios such as driving or walking, safety and convenience
constraints limit users’ ability to interact with mobile devices, making voice a natural and prevalent input modality for expressing
mobility intent. As a result, voice queries provide direct and largely
unconstrained expressions of real user intent, encompassing destination goals, situational information needs, and explicit preference constraints. In our dataset, these voice queries are transcribed
into text and treated uniformly as query inputs for subsequent
processing. From a large corpus of raw queries, we construct the
benchmark through a multi-stage filtering and curation pipeline,
resulting in a substantial collection of high-quality episodes. Under
a strict no-clarification assumption, where each query must be selfcontained and solvable without follow-up interaction, we remove
malformed, underspecified, or ambiguous requests and deduplicate
near-identical queries to ensure diversity.
Following this approach, we leverage Qwen-4B to perform intent classification over the curated queries, identifying diverse
real-world mobility scenarios that define the task taxonomy of
our benchmark. Specifically, we initialize the process with two
coarse-grained intent roots: information access (e.g., POI, traffic,
and weather lookup) and route planning (e.g., navigation to a destination). To identify long-tail and previously unobserved intents, we
adopt an open-set labeling protocol, whereby queries that cannot
be aligned with existing labels prompt the model to propose new
candidate intents along with concise definitions. These candidate labels are subsequently iteratively consolidated, merged, and refined
through multiple rounds of expert adjudication, ensuring semantic clarity, mutual exclusivity, and comprehensive coverage of the

intent space. The resulting taxonomy comprises 11 task scenarios,
which are further organized into four high-level Task families:
• Basic Information Retrieval, which encompasses fundamental information-seeking tasks, including POI Query, Geolocation
Query, Nearby Query, Weather Query, and Traffic Info Query.
• Route-Dependent Information Retrieval, which targets information needs that require computing a route as an intermediate step, including Route Property Query (e.g., distance or path
characteristics) and Arrival/Departure Time Query.
• Basic Route Planning, which consists of two standard navigation tasks: Point-to-Point Planning, routing from a single origin
to a single destination, and Multi-stop Planning, routing across
multiple intermediate destinations.
• Preference-Constrained Route Planning, which covers route
planning tasks involving explicit user-specified preferences or
constraints beyond basic navigation. This family includes OptionConstrained Route Planning, which applies tool-native, standardized routing options such as minimizing tolls, preferring highways, optimizing for the fastest route, fewer transfers, or less
walking; and Route-Constrained Planning, which enforces explicit
path-level constraints specified by users, such as required waypoints or excluded roads.
Table 1 presents representative examples for each task scenario,
while detailed scenario definitions and additional examples are
provided in Appendix A, Table S1.
3.1.3 Ground-Truth Construction. To enable automated evaluation, we construct a structured ground-truth annotation 𝑦 for each
episode following scenario-specific standard operating procedures
(SOPs) defined by domain experts, which specify the minimal sequence of tool interactions required to correctly resolve a query.
Specifically, we construct a scenario-specific standard tool program
that defines the minimal sequence of tool calls required to answer
a query. The workflow operationalizes the corresponding SOP as
a structured and executable program, executes it within an existing agent framework to orchestrate tool invocations, validates the
resulting outputs against historical data with reliability filtering,
and consolidates the full execution trace together with key intermediate artifacts into a ground-truth archive. The standard tool

MobilityBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Route-Planning Agents in Real-World M
program consists of three core steps: (i) extracting and normalizing query slots such as points of interest, temporal constraints,
travel modes, and user preferences; (ii) resolving textual locations
into structured entities or geographic coordinates via POI retrieval
or geocoding tools; and (iii) after parameter validation, invoking
downstream tools including routing, real-time traffic, and weather
services while verifying constraint feasibility when applicable. The
resulting tool evidence is then converted into a structured reference
𝑦 for automated evaluation and diagnostic analysis.
3.1.4 Deterministic Replay Sandbox. During ground-truth construction, we rely on tools provided by the AMap Web Service API1
to derive reference outputs. During evaluation, however, agents are
prohibited from querying live API endpoints, as real-time updates
(e.g., dynamic traffic and weather conditions) and external factors
(e.g., API rate limits) would otherwise introduce non-determinism
and compromise fair and reproducible comparisons. Instead, all
tool interactions are routed through a deterministic replay sandbox
that serves pre-recorded, contextually consistent responses.
The replay sandbox returns responses captured during groundtruth execution and ensures deterministic behavior across agent
runs. Each tool invocation is resolved from a pre-recorded cache
keyed by canonicalized arguments, such as normalized coordinates
and standard time formats. When an exact cache hit is unavailable,
the sandbox applies task-appropriate fallback strategies, including fuzzy matching for entity-based queries and nearest-neighbor
spatial matching for coordinate-based queries, subject to a maximum distance threshold. All tool invocations undergo strict schema
validation, including required-field checks and type and range constraints. Calls that fail validation or cannot be resolved are treated
as tool-use failures and are explicitly reflected in the evaluation
metrics (Section 3.2), enabling fair and reproducible evaluation.
3.1.5 Dataset Statistics. After constructing ground-truth, we filter
out episodes whose answers cannot be reliably obtained or verified
via tool execution, retaining only episodes with executable and
checkable outcomes. As a result, MobilityBench contains 100,000
episodes covering diverse geographic regions. Specifically, our
benchmark spans 22 countries and over 350 cities (including metropolitan areas), with a long-tailed distribution across locations.
We report the scenario distribution across the 11 intents , where
36.6% of episodes belong to Basic Information Retrieval tasks, 9.6%
to Route-Dependent Information Retrieval tasks, 42.5% to Basic
Route Planning tasks, and 11.3% to Preference-Constrained Route
Planning tasks.
3.2 Evaluation Protocol
To enable a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of route-planning
agents across diverse mobility scenarios, we introduce a multidimensional evaluation protocol. Existing evaluations predominantly rely on end-to-end success rates, which treat agent behavior
as a black box and obscure the intermediate failures along the
decision-making chain. Such coarse-grained metrics are insufficient for diagnosing the complex reasoning processes required in
realistic route planning tasks. To address this limitation, our protocol decomposes an agent’s behavior into four core capabilities:

Figure 2: Global coverage of MobilityBench Data.
Instruction Understanding, Planning, Tool Use, and Decision Making,
corresponding to the key stages of route-planning reasoning. Each
capability is further quantified using a set of fine-grained indicators,
enabling precise diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and failure
modes that are invisible to end-to-end metrics.
3.2.1 Instruction Understanding. Since accurate interpretation of
user requirements is a prerequisite for route planning, we first evaluate the agent’s instruction understanding capability. Drawing on
standard paradigms in natural language understanding [1, 13], this
capability is assessed through two indicators, detailed as follows:
Intent Detection (ID). We quantify the agent’s ability to understand the instructional intent embedded in a user query. Specifically,
the agent is explicitly instructed to output a set of intent labels corresponding to the task scenario categories defined in Section 3.1.2.
We measure intent detection by comparing the agent’s predicted
intent label 𝑦ˆ (𝑥) with the ground-truth intent label 𝑦 (𝑥) for
ID ID
each query 𝑥. A prediction is considered correct if the similarity
between the two labels exceeds a predefined threshold 𝛼 .
threshold
The overall intent detection score is computed as:
1 ∑︁
ID = I(sim(𝑦ˆ (𝑥), 𝑦 (𝑥)) ≥ 𝛼 ) . (1)
|X| ID ID threshold
𝑥 ∈X
Information Extraction (IE). This indicator evaluates an agent’s
ability to extract explicit and implicit constraints from user queries,
including spatial attributes (e.g., origins and destinations), temporal parameters (e.g., departure windows and duration constraints),
and preference-related signals (e.g., traffic avoidance or modality
priorities). For a query 𝑥, let 𝑦ˆ (𝑥) and 𝑦 (𝑥) denote the predicted
IE IE
and ground-truth constraint sets, respectively. An extraction is considered correct only if the two sets exactly match. The overall IE
score is computed as:
1 ∑︁
IE = I(𝑦ˆ (𝑥) = 𝑦 (𝑥)) . (2)
|X| IE IE
𝑥 ∈X
3.2.2 Planning. Effective planning is a core capability of LLMbased agents, especially in real-world mobility scenarios where
route planning requires multi-step reasoning under uncertainty.
This dimension evaluates the agent’s ability to generate a logically
coherent and sequential execution plan for complex routing tasks.
Task Decomposition (DEC). This dimension evaluates an agent’s
ability to decompose a high-level user goal into a coherent sequence
of atomic actions, reflecting whether the agent produces the right
steps without omissions or redundancy. Given a predicted action

Conference acronym ’XX,
sequence 𝑉 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑥) = {𝑣 1 , 𝑣 2 , ..., 𝑣 𝑛} and the corresponding groundtruth sequence 𝑉 𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑥), we assess task decomposition quality by
jointly considering step coverage and step correctness, that is,
DEC-P =
1 ∑︁ |𝑉 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑥) ∩𝑓𝐷𝐸𝐶 𝑉 𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑥)|
,
|X| 𝑥 ∈X |𝑉 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 |

DEC-R =
1 ∑︁ |𝑉 𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑥) ∩𝑓𝐷𝐸𝐶 𝑉 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑥)|
,
|X| 𝑥 ∈X |𝑉 𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑 |
where 𝐴 ∩𝑓𝐷𝐸𝐶 𝐵 = {𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 | ∃𝑏 ∈ 𝐵, 𝑓 𝐷𝐸𝐶 (𝑎, 𝑏) = True} and
𝑓 𝐷𝐸𝐶 (·, ·) is a function that determines whether two atomic actions
are considered a match.
3.2.3 Tool Use. Tool invocation serves as the interface between the
agent and the sandbox environment. To comprehensively evaluate
an agent’s tool invocation capability, we define three evaluation
indicators: tool selection, schema compliance, and parameter filling.
Tool Selection (TS). This metric evaluates whether an agent correctly identifies the required tool(s) from a candidate tool set T
based on the inferred user intent. Let 𝑇 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑥) denote the set of
tools selected by the agent, and 𝑇 𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑥) denote the ground-truth
set of required tools. We measure tool selection quality from two
complementary aspects: coverage and redundancy. Coverage reflects whether all necessary tools are selected, while redundancy
penalizes unnecessary tool calls, (for easier comparison, we report
redundancy as its complement.

TS-P = .
|X| 𝑥 ∈X |𝑇 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 |
(4)
1 ∑︁ |𝑇 𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑥) ∩ 𝑇 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑥)|
TS-R = ,
|X| 𝑥 ∈X |𝑇 𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑 |
Schema Compliance (SC). This metric evaluates whether an
agent’s tool invocation conforms to predefined API specifications,
requiring that all mandatory parameters are provided and that their
values fall within valid formats and ranges. For each query 𝑥, let
𝑆𝑇 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑥) denote the sequence of tool invocations produced by the
agent, and let 𝑃 (𝑡) denote the set of parameters associated with
each tool call 𝑡 ∈ 𝑆𝑇 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑥). We define 𝑓 𝑆𝐶 (𝑃 (𝑡), 𝑡) as an indicator
function that determines whether the parameters provided for a
tool 𝑡 conform to the predefined valid formats and ranges. Along
this line, the overall SC score is calculated by:
1 ∑︁ 1 ∑︁
SC = |X| 𝑥 ∈X (cid:12) (cid:12) 𝑆𝑇 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑥) (cid:12) (cid:12) 𝑡 ∈𝑆𝑇𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑥) 𝑓 𝑆𝐶 (𝑃 (𝑡), 𝑡) . (5)
3.2.4 Decision Making. Decision quality evaluates whether an
agent can produce a final solution and whether that solution is
correct. We assess this dimension using the following two metrics:
Delivery Rate (DR). This indicator measures the proportion of
queries for which an agent successfully generates a complete and
executable final output (e.g., a full itinerary) without interruption
or tool invocation failure. This metric reflects the agent’s ability to
complete the end-to-end task pipeline.
Final Pass Rate (FPR). This indicator evaluates the effectiveness
of the generated solution. A solution is considered successful only
if it satisfies all user-specified explicit and implicit constraints, capturing the agent’s ability to produce a valid final outcome.

Song & Zhang et al.
3.2.5 Efficiency. In addition to agent behavioral quality, we evaluate efficiency to characterize computational overhead and practical
deployability. We consider the following indicator:
Input Token (IT). This metric measures the cumulative volume of
contextual information processed by the model, including system
prompts, task instructions, and the historical trajectory of observations and actions. A higher IT count typically reflects a heavier
reliance on long-context reasoning or a more verbose feedback loop.
Output Token (OT). This metric quantifies the total number of
tokens generated by the model. While higher OT indicate more
thorough reasoning, it also implies increased generation time and
resource consumption.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Setup
4.1.1 Data Sampling. Our benchmark is constructed from 100,000
episode 𝑒 collected from real-world mobility scenarios. To balance
statistical significance with computational efficiency, we performed
stratified random sampling across the 11 core performance analysis
scenarios defined in Section 3.1.2, while jointly enforcing stratification by city. Specifically, we strive to maintain a balanced sample
distribution across scenarios while maintaining proportional coverage across diverse urban regions and city tiers, thereby mitigating
geographic bias during scenario selection. This joint sampling strategy yields a final evaluation set of 7,098 episodes for subsequent
analysis of agent performance.
4.1.2 LLM Backbones. We evaluated a diverse suite of representative open-source and closed-source LLMs as the backbones of routplanning agents, spanning a broad range of model characteristics:
(i) small- and large-parameter dense models, (ii) Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architectures, and (iii) reasoning-oriented (Thinking) models.
Open-source backbones. We evaluated the Qwen family (Qwen34B, Qwen3-30B-A3B, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-235B-A22B) and DeepSeek
models (DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp).
Closed-source backbones. We evaluated OpenAI GPT models
(GPT-4.1, GPT-5.2), Anthropic Claude models (Claude-Opus-4.5,
Claude-Sonnet-4.5), and Google Gemini models (Gemini-3-ProPreview, Gemini-3-Flash-Preview).
4.1.3 Agent Implementations. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMbased agent workflows for route planning, we constructed routeplanning agents based on two representative frameworks: ReAct [32]
and Plan-and-Execute [26]. At this stage, we did not incorporate
alternative agent frameworks such as LLM Compiler, LATS, or Treeof-Thought [14, 15, 31, 38]. This design choice was motivated by two
considerations. First, the selected frameworks are widely regarded
as representative of mainstream agent reasoning pipelines, covering reactive and planning-based paradigms. Second, approaches
such as LATS and Tree-of-Thought typically incur substantially
higher computational overhead and exhibit limited adaptability to
the task-specific constraints, tool interactions, and latency requirements inherent in our route-planning setting.
4.1.4 Experimental Details. To ensure reproducibility and fair comparison, we applied a unified set of evaluation settings across all
LLM backbones and agent frameworks.

Agent Inputs. Each agent instance received the user query along
with spatial context signals, such as city and geographic location.
When tool use was enabled, we additionally provided structured
tool schemas or invocation patterns to standardize tool usage across
different frameworks and backbones.
Model Configuration. To further control evaluation variance, we
set the sampling temperature to 0.1 for all evaluated LLM backbones
and capped the maximum output length at 8, 192 tokens.
Agent Configuration. To balance inference efficiency and robustness (e.g., preventing degenerate tool-calling loops), we limited the
maximum number of inference steps to 10.
4.2 Experimental Results
4.2.1 Overall Performance.
LLM performance. Under the Plan-and-Execute framework, Claude
Opus-4.5 stands out as the strongest performer, achieved a Delivery Rate of 83.53% and a Final Pass Rate of 65.77%, both the
highest among all evaluated models in this setting. Within the ReAct framework, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview attained the highest FPR of
69.09%. This result highlights its exceptional ability to preserve taskrelevant context and maintain goal focus across extended iterative
inference loops.
Closed-Source vs. Open-Source Models. As shown in Table 2,
Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview still maintained a clear
lead in instruction understanding dimensions, with average scores
of 90.88% and 88.61% under the ReAct framework. However, the

gap is narrowing significantly. Among open-source models, Qwen3235B-A22B, a MoE architecture activating only 22B parameters
per forward pass, achieved a DR of 85.95% and an FPR of 66.69%
under the ReAct framework. Similarly, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp demonstrated strong competitiveness, attaining an FPR of 68.88% while
maintaining substantially lower inference costs due to its efficient
architecture. This provides a high-performance and cost-effective
option for enterprise-level private deployments.
Framework Comparison: ReAct vs. Plan-and-Execute. A systematic comparison of the two execution architectures reveals a
fundamental trade-off between task success rate and computational
efficiency. The final pass rate of the ReAct is generally better than
that of Plan-and-Execute. This is mainly due to its closed-loop
"think-act-observe" mechanism, which allows the agent to dynamically adjust its strategy based on real-time results returned by
tools, while Plan-and-Execute’s static pre-planning shows a significant lack of robustness when facing dynamic feedback in mobile
scenarios. However, ReAct’s superior robustness comes at a nontrivial computational cost. Due to the continuous accumulation
of observation history within the inference context, the average
number of input tokens (IT) consumed by ReAct is significantly
higher than that of Plan-and-Execute. Across all models, ReAct’s
average IT is approximately 35.38% higher than Plan-and-Execute’s.
This increase translates directly into higher API costs and longer
wall-clock inference times.

4.2.2 Scenario Study. To further reveal the capabilities of the model
in different task scenarios, we created multi-dimensional indicator
radar charts for four core categories in Figure 3, evaluating representative open-source and closed-source models under both ReAct
and Plan-and-Execute frameworks. The scene from left to right
represents a significant increase in the depth of task logic and the
complexity of constraints, and Preference-constrained Planning is
the category where the model is the most likely to be error as we expected. In this type of tasks, Plan-and Execute framework performs
best because it establishes a clear strategy in advance, which makes
handling structured tasks with logical order more predictable and
efficient, thereby suppressing illusions and trajectory deviations.
4.2.3 Model Study. We conduct a model-centric study to examine
how model scaling and reasoning mode (Thinking vs. Non-thinking)
influence route-planning agent performance on MobilityBench.
Scaling effect. Experiments reveal a clear performance gap across
model sizes (Table 2). Under the same dense architecture, scaling
the base model from 4B to 32B yields a consistent improvement in
average success rate, increasing by 0.91%. Under the MoE setting,
Qwen-30B-A3B further scales to Qwen-235B-A22B, bringing an
additional gain of 5.43% . Overall, these results align with the classic
scaling law: increasing parameter scale leads to higher success rates
in real-world mobility scenarios. By jointly examining DEC-P and
DEC-R, we observe that, compared with smaller models, larger
models tend to produce longer solution trajectories (i.e., more plans)
to explore a broader space of possible outcomes. Although some
of these steps can be redundant, this more exhaustive search-andverification process ultimately improves the task success rate.
Thinking vs. Non-thinking. To examine the intrinsic potential
of LLMs on complex route-planning tasks, we study the impact
of reasoning mode (Thinking vs. Non-thinking) while accounting
for the extra cost and latency introduced by Thinking. We sample
1,000 representative instances from MobilityBench for a controlled
comparison, and evaluate how different reasoning patterns affect
final task success. Figure 4 reports the final pass rate of each model
with and without Thinking enabled.
We evaluate Qwen-4B, Qwen-32B, Qwen-30B-A3B, and Qwen235B-A22B under both settings, and additionally include DeepSeekR1 as a strong reasoning-oriented baseline (Figure 4). DeepSeek-R1

our high-level task families.
Figure 4: Final pass rate comparison (Thinking vs. Nonthinking) under the Plan-and-Execute framework.
achieves a final pass rate of 70.46%, serving as a competitive reference point. Across models, enabling thinking consistently improves
performance, with the largest gain observed for Qwen-30B-A3B,
final pass rate increased by 5.98% absolutely. Despite these gains,
Thinking substantially increases the generated token volume, leading to markedly higher inference cost and latency. This overhead
makes it challenging to deploy Thinking-enabled agents in realtime, production-grade online settings.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we presented MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for
the systematic evaluation of LLM-based route-planning agents in
real-world mobility scenarios. Built from large-scale, anonymized
real user queries, MobilityBench captured the diversity and complexity of everyday mobility demands while enabling reproducible,
end-to-end evaluation through a deterministic API-replay sandbox.
We further introduced a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity and complemented by assessments of
instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using
MobilityBench, we evaluated multiple LLM-based route-planning
agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and conducted
an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance, revealing both their strengths and limitations under realistic conditions.
MobilityBench provides a robust and extensible foundation for advancing research on route-planning agents and for enabling fair
and reproducible comparison across LLMs and agent frameworks.
