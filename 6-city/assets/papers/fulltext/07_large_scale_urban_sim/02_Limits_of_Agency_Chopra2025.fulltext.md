1 INTRODUCTION
Many of the today’s challenges — from epidemics to housing shortages to humanitarian crises — emerge from the complex interplay
of countless individuals making decisions and interacting over time.
Agent-based models (ABMs) aim to capture these dynamics by
simulating collections of agents that act and interact within computational environments. ABMs have proven useful across various
domains, including epidemiology [7, 21, 23], economics [5, 6], and
disaster response [8, 18]. For instance, they were used to evaluate
vaccination protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic [7, 21, 43],
predict the crash of housing markets [6, 17], and design evacuation
programs for war refugees [18, 29]. Their utility in addressing policy
questions stems from the ability to model interventions by simulating the interplay between individual behaviors and environmental
dynamics.
However, the practical application of ABMs has been hindered
by two major challenges. First, the high computational costs associated with simulating and calibrating large-scale models have limited
their widespread adoption [9]. Recent advancements in deep learning have addressed some of these challenges, enabling the simulation of complex dynamics over millions of agents using vectorized
operations [11, 42] and the calibration of models to heterogeneous
data sources using differentiable programming [2, 11, 14, 30, 41, 46].
In such differentiable ABMs, deep neural networks also help specify complex environment dynamics [31], and autograd facilitates
sensitivity analysis in zero-shot [39]. Hence, it is now feasible to
simulate, calibrate, and analyze ABMs with millions of agents using
commodity hardware. Second, and perhaps more critical, is the
lack of expressiveness in ABM agents. Many ABMs rely on simplistic, rule-based agent behaviors that fail to capture the nuanced,
adaptive decision-making of real-world individuals.
Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in text-based applications [3, 35, 47], suggesting a possible
solution to the challenge of creating more realistic agent behaviors.
LLM-powered agents have demonstrated potential to enable more
general and adaptive human-like behavior [22, 45]. However, integrating LLMs into large-scale ABMs remains problematic. While
promising work on multi-agent simulations with LLM-agents has
been performed [36, 48], it has primarily been limited to tabletop games and small population scenarios (few hundred agents).
Querying an LLM for each individual agent’s decision at every time
step quickly becomes computationally infeasible as the number of
agents grows into the millions, which is often necessary for studying large-scale complex systems like epidemics or supply chain
networks. The goal of our research is to bridge this gap.

Contribution: This work introduces LLM archetypes, a novel
methodology that efficiently integrates LLMs into ABMs while
maintaining the ability to simulate millions of agents. Our key
insight is that by querying LLMs for representative agent types
rather than individual agents, we can achieve a balance between behavioral complexity and computational efficiency. LLM archetypes
identify representative agent types and use LLM queries to inform
the behavior of entire groups of similar agents. Importantly, our
approach does not lead to a degenerate solution where all agents
within a group make identical decisions. Archetypes maintain action heterogeneity within each group through probabilistic sampling, while significantly reducing the computational burden.
Our approach demonstrates two crucial advantages of LLM
archetypes: computational feasibility and enhanced performance.
First, we show that LLM archetypes can reproduce population-wide
individual behaviors with significantly fewer queries compared to
fully LLM-powered agents. This dramatic reduction in computational overhead enables the simulation of millions of agents, which
is often necessary for studying large-scale complex systems. Second,
LLM archetypes achieve better calibration, and enable flexible counterfactual analysis by preserving simulation scale. We highlight the
nuanced trade-off between individual agency and simulation scale,
demonstrating that archetypes outperform both fully-adaptive LLM
agents (limited to smaller populations due to computational constraints) and simple heuristic agents (which lack adaptivity).
To validate the concept of archetypes, we present a comprehensive analysis using a case study of the COVID-19 pandemic in New
York City, simulating 8.4 million agents. This case study showcases
how LLM archetypes offer a balanced solution that preserves both
adaptive behaviors and computational efficiency. To facilitate utilization across diverse ABMs, we extend AgentTorch - a framework
for large-scale agent-based modeling [12] - to support Archetypes
and LLM-powered behaviors.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we define the tasks of simulating, calibrating, and
analyzing an ABM. We introduce the relevant notation and definitions to formulate the presented experiments. We also formalize
the notion of an agent within an ABM and motivate the challenge
in scaling LLM-based agent simulations to large populations.
2.1 Agent-based Modeling
Consider an ABM composed of 𝑁 agents. We denote by 𝒔𝑖 (𝑡) the
state of agent 𝑖 at simulation time 𝑡, which contains both static and
time-evolving properties of agents. For instance, 𝒔 may represent
the age and sex of a person and their infected status. As the simulation proceeds, an agent 𝑖 updates their state 𝒔𝑖 (𝑡) by interacting
with their neighbours N𝑖 (𝑡) and their environment 𝑒 (𝑡), which can
both also be time evolving. The neighbourhood of an agent can be
specified using a graph, a proximity metric, or other methods. We
denote by 𝑚 𝑖 𝑗 (𝑡) the message or information that agent 𝑖 obtains
from their interaction with agent 𝑗. In the case of an epidemiological ABM, this may represent the transmission of infection from
agent 𝑗 to agent 𝑖. We can then write the agent’s update rule as
(cid:16) (cid:17)
𝒔𝑖 (𝑡 + 1) = 𝑓 𝒔𝑖 (𝑡), ∪𝑗 ∈N(𝑖) 𝑚 𝑖 𝑗 (𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡), 𝜽 , (1)

where 𝜽 are the structural parameters of the ABM. For instance,
𝜽 may correspond to the infectivity of a virus, or the vaccination
efficacy. Similarly, the environment can also have its own dynamics
that depend on the agent’s updates and actions,
𝒆(𝑡 + 1) = 𝑔 (𝒔(𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡), 𝜽 ) . (2)
The specific choices of 𝑓 and 𝑔 define the dynamics of the ABM
system and they are typically stochastic functions which can be
mechanistically specified or learned from data.
Simulating an ABM consists of picking an initial condition
for the agents and environment states (𝒔(0), 𝑒 (0)) and recursively
applying Equation 1 and Equation 2. Despite the very large size of
the simulated state space, we are mainly interested in a collection
of aggregate outcomes over agent states. For most ABMs, this corresponds to a multivariate time-series 𝒙𝑡 = ℎ(𝒔(𝑡)). For example, in
epidemiological ABMs ℎ corresponds to summing over the infected
agents to obtain the daily number of infected agents. Once the
functional form of an ABM has been set, the simulation of an ABM
can be conceived as a stochastic simulator,
𝒙 = 𝐹 (𝜽, 𝒔(0), 𝒆(0)), (3)
where 𝐹 = (𝑓 , 𝑔) ◦ · · · ◦ (𝑓 , 𝑔). The composition is repeated for 𝑇
time-steps.
Calibrating an ABM refers to the process of finding a set of
structural parameters 𝜽ˆ, or a probability distribution over 𝜽 , such
that 𝐹 (𝜽ˆ, 𝒔(0), 𝑒 (0)) produces an output 𝒙 that is consistent with
real-world data 𝒚. There are various techniques for calibrating
ABMs, including approximate Bayesian computation [37] and neural likelihood and posterior estimation [14], among others.
Once calibrated, we can execute sensitivity analyses on ABMs
to understand past events (retrospective), explore alternative scenarios (counterfactual), and design future policies (prospective) [40, 43].
This analytical capability makes ABMs powerful tools for policy
design and positions them to address the Lucas critique [26].
2.2 Scaling Agent-based Models
Recent advancements, particularly in differentiable ABMs, have
made it feasible to simulate, calibrate, and analyze ABMs with
millions of agents using commodity hardware. A differentiable
ABM [4, 11, 41] is an ABM for which the gradient
𝜂 = ∇ E[𝐹 (𝜽 )] (4)
𝜽
exists and can be computed. This allows ABMs to improve calibration by using gradient-assisted techniques to integrate heterogeneous data[15, 41], accelerate simulations on CPUs and GPUs via
tensorization [10], compose with neural networks in end-to-end differentiable pipelines [11, 32, 33] and accelerate sensitivity analyzes
with gradients [40].
AgentTorch [12] is an open-source framework that allows to
generalize these capabilities across diverse ABMs. Its key feature is
the ability to differentiate through the simulation (𝑓 , 𝑔), enabling
gradient-based optimization of model parameters 𝜽 . Through smoothing and reparameterization techniques, AgentTorch achieves differentiability in discrete stochastic programs and allows for the
simulation of tens of millions of agents on consumer-grade GPUs.
However, these large-scale simulations have only focused on heuristic. The focus on our work is to preserve this simulation scale while

incorporating LLMs to capture adaptive agent behavior. We build
on top of AgentTorch for our experiments and analysis. Its flexibility in composing various agent rules and environments makes
it a suitable framework for benchmarking agents defined by both
heuristic and LLM-based behaviors.
2.3 Agency in Agent-based Models
Conventional ABMs typically use heuristic agents update rules 𝑓
(Equation 1) derived from observational data or grounded in theory.
However, these rules may not explicitly differentiate between components that depend on agent behaviour and those that depend on
the environmental dynamics. An illustrative example of this is the
dependence of the probability of infection on the basic reproduction
number 𝑅 0. 𝑅 0 corresponds to the expected number of cases directly
generated by one infected individual. This parameter definition,
however, does not allow to distinguish whether a high number of
cases is driven by the agent’s behaviour (i.e., they interact more),
or an increase in the infectivity of the virus (i.e., each contact is
more infectious).
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened
new possibilities for creating more realistic and adaptive agent
behaviors in ABMs. Integrating LLMs into ABMs can help decouple agent behavior dynamics from environmental dynamics. This
modification to the agent update rule (Equation 1) is expressed as:
(cid:16) (cid:17)
𝒔𝑖 (𝑡 + 1) = 𝑓 𝒔𝑖 (𝑡), ∪𝑗 ∈N(𝑖) 𝑚 𝑖 𝑗 (𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡), 𝜽, ℓ (·|𝒔𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡), 𝜽 ) , (5)
where ℓ (·|𝒔𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡), 𝜽 ) is the LLM output. For example, when modeling the infection probability of an agent, an LLM could parameterize behaviour related mask-wearing compliance. To interpret
the LLM output as an action within the ABM environment, we
instruct the ABM to return yes / no answers to our prompts. In
other words, given an action 𝛼 (i.e., will the agent isolate at home?)
with unknown probability 𝑝, we use the LLM as a proxy,
𝛼 ∼ Bernoulli(p) = ℓ (·|𝒔𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡), 𝜽 ). (6)
Several recent works has explored integrating LLMs as ABM
agents. Notably, "Smallville" [36] simulates 25 LLM-powered agents
coordinating to plan a party together, [19] simulates disease spread
over 100 LLM-powered agents, [25] build an expressive environment of macroeconomic dynamics but simulate only 300 agents, [49]
simulates 1000 LLM-powered agents interacting in minecraft with
the aim to capture self-organization in societies. [48] built an ABM
framework where both agents and environment are modeled using
LLMs. While promising, these works have been limited to small
population scenarios (few hundred agents) and not designed to
integrate real-world population data [20]. Integrating LLMs into
large-scale ABMs remains challenging but is necessary for evaluating population-scale complex systems and guiding real-world
policy decisions. The focus of our work is to preserve the simulation
scale while incorporating LLMs to capture adaptive agent behavior,
addressing the critical trade-off between individual agent expressiveness and computational feasibility in large-scale simulations.

individuals to representative archetypes (based on prompt
template), (2) querying LLMs for archetype behaviors and
estimating action distributions, and (3) sampling individual
agent decisions from action distribution of representative
archetype. This approach enables efficient scaling of adaptive
behaviors to large agent populations.
3 LLM ARCHETYPES: SCALING LLM AS ABM
AGENTS
Understanding complex systems often requires the simulation of
the entire population of agents to correctly capture emergent scalesensitive effects. For instance, while the agency or intelligence of
an individual ant may be quite limited, the simulation of the entire
colony captures coordination processes wherein ants use themselves as bridges for other ants to use. In these large systems, however, it is infeasible to query Equation 6 for each agent, time-step,
and specific action. This problem can be overcome by recognizing
that the number of different behaviors is typically much smaller
than the number of agents. In other words, we only need to query
the LLM to inform the behaviour over each unique set of agents’
characteristics. For instance, if we consider that the behavior is
purely informed by age and gender, we only need to consider one
LLM query per different combination of age and sex. We refer to
each of these unique combinations as archetypes.
For each possible agent action 𝛼, we can estimate its probability
𝑝 𝛼 in Equation 6 using Monte-Carlo,
𝑝 𝛼 (𝒔𝒊 (𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡), 𝜽 ) = E [ℓ (·|𝒔𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡), 𝜽 )]
𝑀
1 ∑︁ (7)
≈ 𝜉 𝑖 with 𝜉 𝑖 ∼ ℓ (·|𝑠 𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡), 𝜽 ).
𝑀
𝑗=1
By estimating 𝑝 𝛼 (𝑘) for each archetype 𝑘, we can simulate the
action of its agent by sampling the action from the archetype to
which it belongs. Let 𝐾 be the number of agent archetypes and 𝐴
be the number of LLM-queryable actions; we can then simulate the
behaviour of all agents with 𝐾 × 𝐴 queries, which will be typically

much smaller than the number of agents 𝑁 , allowing us to scale
the simulation to millions of agents. This is shown in Figure 1.
4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
This section formalizes the simulation environment we use to evaluate LLM archetypes and analyze the trade-off between agency and
simulation scale. We consider a large-scale ABM of New York City
during the COVID-19 pandemic, simulating 8.4 million individuals
in a complex real-world scenario.
The COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies the intricate interplay between individual behavior, policy interventions, and environmental factors that our approach aims to capture. Disease spread initially triggered fluctuating mobility patterns and multiple infection waves [44]. Government lockdowns, while controlling spread,
caused severe economic consequences, including unprecedented
unemployment [13]. Stimulus programs, introduced to mitigate economic hardship and encourage compliance to health measure [24],
had unintended effects on labor markets and resource allocation [16].
As the pandemic progressed, "pandemic fatigue" emerged, further
complicating public health compliance and economic recovery [38].
This complex feedback loop between health outcomes, economic
conditions, and human behavior provides an ideal environment to
demonstrate the benefit of capturing and simulating adaptive agent
behaviors at scale.
Environment: The agent states have static (age, gender, income, occupation) and dynamic (disease, employment status) attributes. We use 2022 American community survey (ACS) for demographic and household characteristics, the Bureau of Labor Statistics for employment data, and the center for disease control
(CDC) reports for data on disease dynamics, consistent with prior
work [10, 21, 43]. Agent attributes are specified at census-resolution
with demographic and income information discretized into bins.
Interactions occur over household, workplace, and mobility networks, with recreational and workplace mobility parameterized
using Google Mobility trends. Our simulations focus on the dynamics of disease spread and labor market. For disease spread, we
consider a standard epidemiological model [7, 11, 21] wherein infection spreads through contact and the probability of agent 𝑖 getting
infected at step 𝑡 is:
𝛽 𝑆 𝑖 ∑︁
𝑝 𝑖 (𝑡) = 1 − exp (cid:169) (cid:173) − 𝑛 𝐼 𝑗 (𝑡)(cid:170) (cid:174) , (8)
𝑖
𝑗 ∈N(𝑖)
(cid:171) (cid:172)
where N (𝑖) is the set of neighbors of agent 𝑖, 𝑆 𝑖 the susceptibility
of agent 𝑖, 𝐼 𝑗 the infection status of each neighbour, 𝑛 𝑖 = #N (𝑖) the
total number of neighbors, and 𝛽 a structural parameter of the ABM
called the effective contact rate. The neighbourhood N (𝑖) is given
by a contact network constructed from household and mobility
data in the US census.
For labor market, we consider a standard econometric model [25]
which relates participation behavior of individual agents with aggregate unemployment rate at time 𝑡 (𝜇 𝑤,𝑡 ) as:
∑︁
𝜇 𝑤,𝑡 = 𝛾 0 𝑊 𝑗 (𝑡) + 𝛾 1 𝐶 𝑡 (9)
𝑗 ∈N

where 𝑊 𝑗 (𝑡) is the willingness to work for agent 𝑗 at time 𝑡 and 𝐶 𝑡
is the history of unemployment claim rates in the region, obtained
from census data; and 𝛾 0 and 𝛾 1 are the structural parameters.
The epidemiological model forecast cases, while the economic
model forecast unemployment rates. The models are coupled through
a feedback loop: case numbers affect agents’ willingness to work,
which influences labor-force participation rates and workplace interaction networks, which in turn affect disease transmission. We
implement this environment using the AgentTorch framework [12]
which enables differentiate through these stochastic dynamics and
scales to large populations (8.4 million agents). The parameters
(𝛽, 𝛾 0 , 𝛾 1) are calibrated to real-world data for cases and unemployment rates, using a standard protocol for differentiable ABMs [11,
12, 41] (visualized in figure 3). More details are in appendix A.
Behavior: We use LLMs to model isolation and employment behavior of individual agents. Our prompt includes agent demographics, disease dynamics, information about extrinsic interventions
(stimulus payment) and intrinsic behavior adaptation (duration of
pandemic to capture effect of "pandemic fatigue"). The user prompt
template, motivated by [25], is given below:
User Prompt
You are a {gender} of age {age}, living in the {location} region
and receiving a monthly income of {income}.
The number of new cases in your neighborhood is {cases},
which is a {change}% change from the previous month. It
has been {duration} months since the start of the pandemic.
This month, you have received a stimulus payment of {payment} to support your living expenses.
Given these factors, do you choose to isolate at home?
(isolation behavior)
Given these factors, do you choose to work? (employment
behavior)
"There isn’t enough information" and "It is unclear" are not
acceptable answers. Give a "Yes" or "No" answer, followed
by a period. Give one sentence explaining your choice.
The input prompt receives case numbers and pandemic duration
from the past simulation trajectory, instead of ground-truth data,
and outputs agents’ willingness to work𝑊 𝑗 (𝑡) which is further used
in simulation. We conduct such auto-regressive prompting for two
reasons: i) when simulating for prospective interventions, groundtruth data is not available and hence prompt needs to be specified
entirely using simulation, ii) when simulation is un-calibrated, the
model peaks may not align well with real-world data. In such case,
using ground-truth data is unsuitable for capturing the adaptability
of behavior (especially when incorporating time-varying information like infections). Since prompt at step 𝑡 depends upon simulated
trajectory at step 𝑡 − 1, LLMs need to be sampled online during the
simulation. As behavior cannot be sampled offline, the trade-off
between simulation scale and agent behavior becomes particularly
critical. Finally, the stimulus eligibility, timing and amounts are
based on the policy implemented in NYC at the time. Specifically,
December 2020 - March 2021 overlaps with the second stimulus

check which provided adults $ 600 and additional $ 600 for every
child [34]. We use GPT-3.5 for our experiments. The system prompt
provides context about the disease dynamics, relative susceptibility
of different demographics and is provided in Appendix A.
5 VALIDATING ARCHETYPES
The section benchmarks the capacity of Archetypes to prompt behavior consistent with measurable population-wide observations.
We use LLM archetypes to prompt individual-level willingness to
work for 8.4 million synthetic agents (consider responses only for
eligible working adults), focusing on two time-periods: December
2020 to March 2021 (coinciding with the second stimulus round) and
March to May 2022 (post-Omicron wave). We test three scenarios
with increasing contextual information: (Prompt 1) we only provide
demographic attributes of the agent, (Prompt 2) we add information
about disease dynamics, (Prompt 3) we further include information
about access to stimulus payments. For each scenarios, we initialize
3 (𝑀 in equation 7) queries per archetypes representing different
combinations of unique prompts over the considered time frame.
Given the census-resolution (demographic and income attributes
binned for privacy) and prompt design (disease dynamics and stimulus information shared by all agents), this approach requires only
4˜00 LLM queries to sample one decision (weekly) for each individual in the population. This is a significant reduction compared to
millions of queries required in the conventional paradigm.
Following Equation 7, we obtain the probability of each archetype
𝑘 performing action 𝛼 ("will you work?") for each week, 𝑝 𝛼 (𝑘, 𝑡).
By sampling from the induced Bernoulli distributions, we generate
a time-series of work attendance. We aggregate these individuallevel actions to calculate the change in labor force participation rate
across New York boroughs and compute correlation of this time
series with observed data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2.
Results are averaged across 5 independent runs for robustness.
Figure 2 shows increasing correlation between behavior generated by LLM-archetypes and census data as we add more contextual
information to the prompt. This demonstrates the method’s ability
to incorporate nuanced factors - like evolving environments and
incentives - into agent decision making. Notably, archetypes capture positive time-varying correlations in census-level behaviors
for 3 of 5 boroughs (roughly 5 million people across income and
demographic), which is an encouraging result.
In the second experiment (March to May 2022), we test the ability of LLM-archetypes to simulate adaptive behavior over time,
particularly "pandemic fatigue". This period represents the scenario
post-Omicron wave, when stimulus and unemployment payments
had also declined considerably. We modify the prompt to highlight
the time duration since the start of the pandemic and the lack of
financial incentives, testing whether our representative (and individual) agents are sensitive to these changes. We then repeat the
population sampling procedure described in the previous experiment to obtain the time-series and examine cross-correlation with
real-world data on participation rates. Results are presented in Appendix B and highlight the ability of LLM-archetypes to capture
2https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-labor-forceparticipation-rate.htm

how individual behavior adapts over time, which is encouraging
for use in agent-based modeling.
This analysis demonstrates the potential of LLM archetypes to
capture complex, adaptive behaviors in large-scale populations
while maintaining computational efficiency. Despite high-variance
individual responses, archetypes successfully capture positive timevarying correlations with census-level behaviors, an encouraging
outcome for large-scale ABMs. To mitigate biased LLM responses,
we estimation archetype distributions via multiple LLM generations (𝑀 queries per archetype), as motivated by [28]. While these
results are promising, we acknowledge ongoing challenges. First,
real-world behaviors can be significantly more complex than what
our prompt can capture and second, data contamination in LLMs
remains an open challenge with no formal technique to design
prompts for LLM queries. Despite these limitations, the computational efficiency of archetypes - requiring only 400 queries for 8.4
million agents - compared to millions in the conventional approach
represents a significant advance. This efficiency, combined with
the ability to capture adaptive behaviors, makes LLM archetypes a
promising tool for large-scale ABMs. We demonstrate the viability
of this approach for large-scale simulations in Section 6, presenting performance benchmarking results of online LLM sampling
coupled with a highly complex environment.
6 BEHAVIOR AGENCY VS SIMULATION SCALE
This section investigates the impact of incorporating adaptive agent
behavior within ABMs and analyzes the trade-off between agency
and simulation scale when calibrating to real-world data. We simulate dynamics of disease spread and labor market in New York
City from December 2020 to April 2021 and, compare three kinds
of agent architectures: LLM-as-agent, Heuristics and Archetypes.
LLM-as-agent instantiates a unique LLM query per individual agent,
Archetype instantiates 𝑀 LLM queries per representative agent
and heuristic agents used hand-crafted behaviors shared across all
agents. Specifically, heuristic agents use Equation 8 and Equation 9
as they are. For archetype and LLM-as-agent, these equations are
modified to incorporate an action 𝛼 determined by the LLM output
and obtain agent decision to isolate (𝐼 𝑗 ) and work (𝑊 𝑗 ). In terms of
𝐼 𝑗 , this is defined as:
𝐼 𝑗 LLM := 𝐼 𝑗 (𝑡)(1 − ℓ 𝛼 (𝒔𝑗 (𝑡), 𝑒 (𝑡))), (10)

LLMs-as-agents query behavior at individual level and hence using
it to simulate 8.4 million agents is computational infeasible. This
enforces a trade-off between simulation scale and individual agency.
For fair comparison, we fix the prompt budget to 300 LLM queries

Archetypes achieve this superior performance while consuming
95% less run-time compared to LLM-as-agents and marginally more

7 COUNTERFACTUAL SIMULATIONS
The Lucas Critique [27] posits that historical data alone can never
predict what happens when a new policy is adopted, since behavior
may adapt while outcomes are realized. By balancing individual
agency and simulation scale, LLM archetypes allow us to analyze the

relative impact of behavior adaptation and environment dynamics
in shaping real world outcomes. This section explores the interplay
of pandemic fatigue and variant transmissibility on the severity of
disease outbreaks.
We consider transmission of two variants of COVID-19 - Delta
(𝛽 = [2.5−4.0], April 2021) and Omicron (𝛽 = [5.5−8.0], November
2021) - which emerged at different stages of the pandemic. While
Omicron was roughly 2-3 times more transmissible than Delta, it
produced 5-20 times the case intensity [1]. We hypothesize this is
due to the coupled dynamics of time-induced fatigue and increased
transmissibility.
Using our model calibrated to the Delta wave, we conduct two
counterfactual simulations:
Q1: What if we had the delta wave later?: To simulate timeinduced behavior change ("pandemic fatigue"), we update the user
prompt with an artificial offset: "it has been number of {weeks +
OFFSET } since start of the epidemic", where OFFSET is 30 weeks.
Q2: What if we had the omicron wave earlier?: We update 𝛽
in the simulation trace to mimic the Omicron variant while keeping
the same behavioral dynamics.
Figure 5 illustrates the results of our counterfactual analysis,
helping decouple the impact of behavior change and viral transmissibility on disease waves during the pandemic. First, we observe

that time-induced fatigue can alter behavior of individuals with
agents demonstrating lower willingness to isolate when prompted
using the OFFSET( Figure 5(a)). This behavior change can result in a
more severe outbreak even with viral dynamics do not change ( Figure 5(b)). Second, an early onset of "omicron-like variant" would
have been more destructive due to higher transmissibility, but not
as severe as the actual omicron wave. The actual Omicron wave was
exacerbated by the coupled influence of behavior change (additional
"pandemic fatigue" due to extended duration). Such analyses can
inform policy decisions during a pandemic helping appropriately
allocate resources to both clinical and behavioral interventions.
We note that archetypes enable such analysis since they provide
the ability to query adaptations in individual behavior, via expressive natural language, and also measure the cascading impact of
individual decisions at a population scale. These analyses are challenging with other agent architectures due to trade-offs between
simulation scale (compromised when using LLMs for each agent)
and individual agency (lost when using heuristic agents). We note
that for small populations with high-personalized interventions,
LLMs-as-agent can be viable architecture (as explored in works
like [36, 48]). Archetypes are useful when analyzing outcomes in
large populations with demographic-resolved interventions as often
required for policy making.
8 DISCUSSION
This section addresses implementation considerations and limitations. We analyze sensitivity of Archetype-specific design choice
when querying LLMs and introduces an API to generalize utility of
our contributions to diverse scenarios. We also discuss some promising future capabilities and summarize limitations of the work.
LLM Consistency: LLM archetypes are sensitive to the quality
and consistency of agent behaviors, which can vary with the choice
of choice of model and number of queries per archetype (𝑀 in
equation 7). We repeat the experiment in section 3 (using Prompt

3) and analyze sensitivity of individual decisions to model choice
(GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4o) and number of instances per archetype (𝑀=1,
3, 6). Results are shown in Figure 6. First, for lower 𝑀, using the
superior GPT-4o model improves performance. Our algorithm is
agnostic to the choice of LLMs and we anticipate the our results
will become progressively better as LLMs mature, making ABMs
more reliable. Second, for larger 𝑀 - when archetype distributions
are aggregated over multiple queries - performance significantly
improves for GPT-3.5. We hypothesize that this mitigates biased
LLM responses and helps capture realistic variability in individual
behaviors. For future work, we plan to extensively benchmark
different models (both open and closed-source) and design formal
guidelines to specify archetype prompts. Finally, we also note that
the choice of LLM is not the only factor affecting effectiveness. As
demonstrated in Section 6, population scale is also critical for ABMs
where heuristic agents can outperform LLM agents. This highlights
the complex interplay between agent sophistication and simulation
scale in determining overall ABM utility.
Figure 6: Sensitivity analysis to LLM model choice (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o) and number of queries per archetype (M=1, 3, 6)
Archetype API: We extend the AgentTorch framework [12] to
integrate an ’Archetype’ API, allowing the use of LLMs to prompt
agent behavior in large-scale simulations. This API supports both offline and online LLMs, facilitating wider adoption of LLM archetypes
in ABMs. We present a code snippet in Figure 7 and provide additional details including the source code and tutorials in Appendix
D. We will also engage with the AgentTorch developers to integrate
our API within the core framework.
High-resolution Analysis: LLM archetypes enable measuring
granular individual behavior and integrating it with populationscale simulations. Using our model calibrated to borough-level data,
we measure the impact of stimulus payments on employment behavior at a granular zip-code level. In future, such analyses can help
overcome limitations of historical data in policy design ( Figure 8).
Limitations: While our work demonstrates the potential of LLM
archetypes in large-scale ABMs, several challenges and areas for
improvement remain. First, ensuring the robustness and fairness
of LLM-driven agents remains an open challenge, as LLMs can
produce inconsistent or biased outputs, potentially leading to unrealistic agent behaviors. Future work should focus on developing

use of LLM Archetypes. More details in Appendix D.

methods to detect and mitigate these biases. Second, while LLM
archetypes aid scalability, they may not always capture the desired
heterogeneity of individual agents, necessitating the development
of more sophisticated archetype selection and interpolation methods. Third, the current implementation focuses on relatively simple
agent actions, limiting the complexity of decision-making processes
that can be modeled. Extending the action space and implementing
multi-scale archetypes could address this limitation. Fourth, the
potential for data contamination in LLMs, where models may contain anachronistic information relative to the simulation timeframe,
requires careful consideration and the development of techniques
to "time-bound" LLM knowledge. Fifth, verifying the accuracy of
individual agent behaviors generated by LLMs remains challenging,
calling for the development of formal verification methods and
benchmarks. We currently measure performance via comparisons
with mesoscopic census data and generalization of macroscopic
ABM predictions. Despite these limitations, we believe our work
represents a significant step forward in agent-based modeling, opening up new possibilities for understanding and addressing societal
challenges.

9 CONCLUSION
This work introduces LLM archetypes as a novel approach to scale
adaptive agent behavior in large-scale agent-based models (ABMs).
By efficiently integrating LLMs into ABMs, we enable the simulation of millions of agents with nuanced, context-aware behaviors
while maintaining computational feasibility. Our case study on the
COVID-19 pandemic in New York City demonstrates the power of
this approach in capturing complex societal dynamics, balancing individual agency with population-scale outcomes. The framework’s
ability to perform counterfactual analyses addresses key limitations
in policy design, offering a powerful tool for tackling real-world
challenges. While challenges remain in ensuring robustness and
fairness of LLM-driven agents, this work represents a significant
step forward in ABM capabilities. By bridging the gap between
expressive individual agents and large-scale simulations, our approach opens new avenues for modeling complex systems and
informing data-driven policy decisions across various domains.
