## Extracted Abstract

Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have enabled richer social simulations, allowing for the study of various social phenomena. However, most recent work has used a more omniscient perspective on these simulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is fundamentally at odds with the non-omniscient, information asymmetric interactions that involve humans and AI agents in the real world. To examine these differences, we develop an evaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various settings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that LLMs perform better in unrealistic, omniscient simulation settings but struggle in ones that more accurately reflect real-world conditions with information asymmetry. Our findings indicate that addressing information asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge for LLM-based agents.

Abstract
Recent advances in large language models
(LLM) have enabled richer social simulations,
allowing for the study of various social phenomena. However, most recent work has used
a more omniscient perspective on these simulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is fundamentally at odds with
the non-omniscient, information asymmetric
interactions that involve humans and AI agents
in the real world. To examine these differences,
we develop an evaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various
settings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that LLMs perform better in
unrealistic, omniscient simulation settings but
struggle in ones that more accurately reflect
real-world conditions with information asymmetry. Our findings indicate that addressing
information asymmetry remains a fundamental
challenge for LLM-based agents.
1 Introduction
LLM-based social simulations have become great
tools for modeling human behavior in various contexts (Park et al., 2023; Sreedhar and Chilton,
2024), understanding and measuring LLMs’ social skills through certain tasks (Zhou et al., 2024;
Bianchi et al., 2024), improving and aligning chatbot systems by providing training data (Kim et al.,
2023a; Hong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a; Pang
et al., 2024). The success in replicating human-like
social interactions across diverse domains offers a
promising picture of the realistic social capabilities
of LLMs.
However, the role of information asymmetry in
these simulations, i.e., the degree to which interlocutors in interactions have access to each other’s
internal private mental states and goals, has been
largely overlooked (Weber, 1978; Tomasello, 1999;

Figure 1: An illustration between SCRIPT mode simulation and AGENTS mode simulation. In the AGENTS
mode, two agents, each equipped with an LLM, negotiate and strategically seek information to reach a mutual
agreement. Conversely, in SCRIPT mode, a single omniscient LLM orchestrates the entire interaction based
on full access to the agents’ goals. These two modes
end up on opposite sides of the spectrum in terms of
information asymmetry from various perspectives (e.g.,
roles, social goals, secrets, etc.).
Oey et al., 2023)1. Instead of using the more realistic simulation setting that mirrors human daily social interactions with information asymmetry (e.g.,
AGENTS mode in Figure 1), a wide range of prior
research has leveraged a more omniscient perspective to model and simulate social interactions with
LLMs (Liang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Pang
et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2023a). By generating all
sides of interaction at once or making agent social

goals or tasks transparent to all participants, these
simulations diverge from the non-omniscient human interactions that rely on social inference to
achieve goals in real-world scenarios (Goodman
and Frank, 2016). Studying these omniscient simulations could lead to biased or wrong conclusions
about LLMs’ social capabilities (Das et al., 2024).
To investigate the effect of this incongruity, we
create a unified simulation framework with two
distinct modes for simulating human interaction
with LLMs: SCRIPT mode and AGENTS mode. As
shown in Figure 1, in the SCRIPT mode, one omniscient LLM has access to all the information and
generates the entire dialogue from a third-person
perspective (e.g., Kim et al. 2023a; Chen et al.
2023b). In the AGENTS mode, two LLM agents
assume distinct roles and engage in interaction to
accomplish the task (e.g., Zhou et al. 2024). These
modes represent the opposite ends of the spectrum regarding information asymmetry, while the
AGENTS mode is the realistic interaction simulation setting that reflects the information asymmetry
in human daily-life interactions.
We first compare the interactions produced in
these two simulation modes, examining the extent
to which the simulated characters achieve their social goals at the end of the interaction, as well as the
naturalness of the interactions. We find that LLMs
in the AGENTS mode not only struggle to generate
social interactions that effectively meet the specified social goals for each role but also produce less
naturally flowing social interactions, particularly in
their utterances when compared to the LLMs in the
SCRIPT mode. These findings indicate that LLMs
still fall short of acting as agents and simulating social interaction within contexts of realistic human
interaction settings.
We then ask the question of whether LLM agents
can be learned from SCRIPT simulations. Inspired
by Kim et al. (2023a); Hong et al. (2023), we finetune GPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022) on a large
dataset of interactions generated in the SCRIPT
mode. We find that finetuning on omnisciently generated social interactions provides limited improve
for LLMs interacting in the AGENTS mode. Further data analysis reveals the biases within SCRIPT
mode simulations, hindering the ability of models trained on such data to effectively generalize
real-world social skills.
Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for reporting LLM-based agent work, encouraging more careful considerations and transparency

in using LLMs to simulate social interactions from
both data and learning perspectives.
2 Background & Related Work
Agent-based modeling and social simulations have
a long history in social sciences for specific tasks
(e.g., decision making, business, cognitive science,
etc.). More recently, advances in LLMs have
sparked a new wave of simulations tackling more
open-ended and complex social scenarios. We review some recent progress in these directions below
and highlight different themes and shortcomings of
these prior methods.
Simulating Society for Analysis Realistic, humanlike simulation settings have been crucial for
social theory building and hypothesis formation
across various disciplines (Gilbert, 2005; Tesfatsion and Judd, 2006; Huang et al., 2014). The
recent advancements in LLMs have enabled the development of social simulations driven by human
language (Park et al., 2023, 2022; Zhou et al., 2024;
Li et al., 2023a). However, these LLM-based simulations often operate in settings divergent from human social interactions, which may mislead downstream applications and the public’s understanding
of AI capabilities (Hendrycks et al., 2023). Furthermore, many of these works lack a consistent evaluation framework, while SOTOPIA (Zhou et al.,
2024) has begun addressing this gap by offering a
holistic evaluation framework for assessing social
interactions generated by LLMs.
Simulating Interactions for Training A common issue in training social chitchat models (i.e.,
chatbots) is the lack of large-scale, high-quality
training data, which can be addressed by using
LLMs to generate synthetic text data (Smith et al.,
2020; Chen et al., 2023c). Kim et al. (2023a) first
introduced SODA, a large-scale synthetic dataset
for training chatbots to produce more natural and
consistent utterances. There are also works that use
LLMs to generate synthetic data (SCRIPT mode)
for training chatbots in a goal-oriented setting, either using reinforcement learning (Hong et al.,
2023) or using techniques to bootstrap the training data (Ulmer et al., 2024). However, these
works mostly consider chitchat settings and overlook more complex scenarios involving cooperative
or competitive motives. Consequently, the impact
of learning from generated scripts on models’ ability to navigate complex, multi-turn interaction sce-

narios and accomplish social tasks remains elusive.
Information Asymmetry in Communication
Information asymmetry is a characteristic part
of human linguistic interaction (Stalnaker, 2014).
It poses a challenge when we attempt to jointly
achieve goals (Tomasello, 1999) and is exploitable
in cases where one party is attempting to deceive
the other (Oey et al., 2023). It also plays a large
part in the human ability to achieve social goals
in dialogue through strategic information omission and indirectness (Pinker et al., 2008; Yoon
et al., 2020; Radkani et al., 2022; Bridgers et al.,
2023; Achimova et al., 2023; Carcassi and Franke,
2023). In LLM-driven social simulations, information asymmetry is examined through the variability
in prompts provided to each generation iteration.
This incorporates a range of factors including assigned roles (e.g., assistant or user), specific output
restrictions (e.g., "only ask questions"), character
backgrounds (e.g., "you are a doctor"), and particular social objectives (e.g., "your goal is to borrow
$2000"). The varied elements unique to each agent
help simulate the complexities and nuances of reallife social interactions within the framework of the
simulation.
3 SCRIPT vs AGENTS Simulation
To investigate whether the success of the omniscient SCRIPT mode reflects how LLMs would behave in the realistic human communication setting,
we set up a unified framework to generate synthetic text data for different simulation settings and
compare the performance of LLMs in these settings. In this section, we first introduce the general
framework of agent-based simulation and SCRIPT
simulation, and then we simulate social interactions across these settings to answer the following
research questions (RQ): RQ1: Do the SCRIPT
simulations reflect how LLMs achieve social goals
in the realistic soical interaction settings? RQ2:
Do the SCRIPT simulations reflect how LLMs communicate in the realistic soical interaction settings?
3.1 The Unified Framework for Simulation
We build on the Sotopia framework (Zhou et al.,
2024), in which 40 unique characters with relationships interact in 90 diverse social scenarios.
A social task in Sotopia involves a scenario, two
character profiles, and their respective private social goals for the interaction. During an episode,
the two agents, whether AI or human, role-play the

characters to accomplish their social goals. Agents
are allowed to generate utterances (e.g., Ben said:
“how are you?”), non-verbal communication (e.g.,
Ben smiled), and actions (e.g., Ben moved to the
room).
Sotopia primarily focuses on general social interactions between agents, where each agent has
distinct social goals and different information about
the other (AGENTS). To provide a broader comparison, we introduce additional simulation modes.
These various settings are then simulated under a
unified framework to analyze the social interactions
comprehensively.
Social Scenarios We use free-text descriptions
of the social situations and the corresponding social goals for each character from Sotopia. Shared
information includes the scenario context: location,
time, and relevant details of the social interaction
(e.g., “a person selling an antique chair for $100 on
their patio, with another person interested.”). Social goals are only visible to the respective agents
(e.g., “Your goal is to buy the chair for $80”). These
scenarios are designed to cover a wide range of social tasks, such as cooperation and competition.
Characters We set profiles for each agent to roleplay in the simulation from Sotopia. Each character
has rich background information, including their
demographics, personality, occupation, public information (e.g, “has two cats”)and secretive information (e.g., “secretly funds a college student”).2
Different characters have different relationships
with each other, which affect the information they
can access about each other and the social scenarios
they are involved in.
Simulation Modes We explore three simulation
modes in our experiments. For the SCRIPT mode,
one LLM has access to all the information of the
characters, relationships, and social scenarios, and
generates the entire social interactions at one turn
from an omniscient perspective with a third-person
point of view. For the AGENTS mode, each LLM
is assigned a character and has access only to the
information of the corresponding character, relationship, and social scenario. The LLMs interact
with each other to complete the social task from
a first-person point of view in a turn-by-turn manner. Note that unlike other previous works that only

have one or two sources of information asymmetry
(e.g., occupation; Pang et al. 2024), our AGENTS
mode simulation can have a diverse array of asymmetrical factors, including gender, age, occupation,
personality, secretive information, and social goals.
To further study the effects of information asymmetry, we add one ablation setting where each agent
has access to other characters’ information (e.g.,
social goals and secretive information). We refer
to this setting as MINDREADERS mode.3
Simulation Evaluation As human social behaviors are primarily driven by their social goals
(Tomasello, 2021; Weber, 1978), we consider the
ability to complete the social goals as one of the major indicators of the success of social interactions.
Following Sotopia, we use the goal completion
score (ranging from 0 to 10, higher scores indicate
the agents achieve their social goals better) as the
main metric to evaluate the success of the social
interactions across different modes.4 Note that the
goal completion score is a proxy for the success
of the social interactions, and we use model-based
evaluation to obtain the esitmation of the goal completion score following Zhou et al. (2024).
3.2 Experimental setup
We evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-3.5
(Ouyang et al., 2022) and Mixtral-8x7B (Jiang
et al., 2024), on SCRIPT, AGENTS, and MIN3Please refer to the Appendix B to see the full prompts we
design for each mode.

tical significantly different from the other two modes in
DREADERS simulation. In the AGENTS and MINDREADERS mode, agents interact with each other
using the state space model in the Sotopia library.5
We conduct 450 simulations for each model and
each setting with 5 pairs of characters for each social scenario. For evaluation, we use GPT-4 to automatically assess the goal completion rate, which
prior work showed had high correlation with human evaluations in Sotopia (Zhou et al., 2024).6
3.3 RQ1: SCRIPT mode overestimates LLMs’
ability to achieve social goals
Figure 2 shows the average goal completion rate
of different models in different simulation settings.
We find that the SCRIPT and MINDREADERS simulations achieve a significantly higher goal completion rate than the AGENTS simulations. This suggests that information asymmetry hinders agents’
ability to achieve social goals, and SCRIPT mode
vastly overestimates LLMs’ ability to achieve social goals in realistic, humanlike social interaction
settings.
We further narrow down our goal completion
analyses to a set of representative cooperative (i.e.,
MutualFriends) and competitive scenarios (i.e.,
Craigslist). These two tasks represent the two ends
of the cooperativeness-competitiveness spectrum,
which help us isolate the effects of these motives
on goal completion. Specifically, MutualFriends is
a task to find common friend with each character
provided with their friend list (He et al., 2017) and
5https://pypi.org/project/sotopia/
6Please refer to the Appendix F for more details of the
simulation.

Craigslist is a bargaining task given detailed product description and target prices (He et al., 2018).
As shown in Figure 2, in cooperative scenarios, whether agents have access to the other’s mental states is critical to the task, as evidenced by
MINDREADERS and SCRIPT simulations scores
being similar to each other and both significantly
better than AGENTS simulations. In contrast, for
competitive scenarios, access to the other agent’s
information is insufficient to achieve a high goal
completion rate, as evidenced by MINDREADERS
simulations being significantly worse than SCRIPT
simulations. Qualitatively, we find the characters
in the SCRIPT simulations always end up reaching the deal while the characters in the AGENTS
simulations tend to leave when the likelihood of
successful negotiation appears unlikely. We further
investigate the issue in §4.4.
3.4 RQ2: SCRIPT mode overstates LLMs’
capability of natural interactions
The natural flow of interaction (i.e., how LLMs
emulate human-like communication) is an important factor for assessing the abilities of LLMs in
navigating human social scenarios (Shuster et al.,
2022; Sharma et al., 2023). As shown in Figure 3,
the AGENTS simulations are often overly verbose.
To compare the naturalness of the simulations from
different modes, we ask a set of human evaluators to choose the more natural dialogue given a
pair of a SCRIPT and a AGENTS interaction. We
gather 30 annotations for each comparison pair and
conduct significance tests to confirm any observed
differences.7 We additionally measure the average
length of each turn in the dialogues from the two
modes as a coarse-grained proxy of the verbosity
of the generated dialogues.
As shown in Figure 4, we find that the SCRIPT
mode generates social interactions that are substantially more natural than the AGENTS mode. The
overly verbose simulations likely contribute to the
lower naturalness of the generated dialogues. Note
that naturalness is not easy to improve by simply
prompting for brevity, which is likely due to competing prompt instructions in the scenarios.8
Overall, our findings show that drastic disparities
exist between SCRIPT and AGENTS simulations.
7Qualitative analysis finds MINDREADERS simulations
have similar naturalness to AGENTS simulations. See Appendix E for more details on naturalness assessment.
8Please refer to the Appendix H for more details of prompting efforts for increasing the naturalness of the agent-based
simulation.

SCRIPT mode overestimates LLMs’ ability to interact in realistic settings with information asymmetry
(i.e., the AGENTS mode).
4 Learning from Generated Stories
Given that the SCRIPT mode produces more “successful” and natural social interactions, this raises
the question of whether models can improve their
social skills in the more realistic setting (i.e.,
AGENTS mode) by learning from the generated
scripts (Kim et al., 2023a; Hong et al., 2023).
We finetune GPT-3.5 on the simulations of
SCRIPT to answer: RQ3: Can a specialized LLM
finetuned on the SCRIPT simulations reach the
same level of success (goal completion and naturalness) as the SCRIPT simulations in the agent
mode? RQ4: If not, what are the potential aspects
of SCRIPT simulations that hinder the LLMs as
agents from learning social skills?
4.1 Creating New Scenarios
To ensure the finetuning examples resemble the
original nature of the evaluation set of Sotopia,
we create new social scenarios following the same
structure and procedure in Zhou et al. (2024).
Specifically, we create 269 new social scenarios,
each with a unique context and social goal spanning across topics such as bargaining, finding mutual friends, making appointments, etc. Each scenario has 5 pairs of characters, and each pair of
characters has their own background information,
relationship, and social goals. We then generate the
social interactions for each scenario using GPT-3.5
with SCRIPT prompting. This process produces
1,252 valid episodes.9
4.2 Finetuning Setup
Due to the overall high performance of SCRIPT
mode (Figure 2), we choose to finetune GPT-3.5
on the SCRIPT generations following Kim et al.
(2023a). Specifically, we first convert the generated social interactions into several structured
subparts: (1) The perspective/speaker instruction
i (e.g., “Imagine you are Eli Dawson, your task
is to act/speak as Eli Dawson would, keeping in
mind Eli Dawson’s social goal.”), (2) The context
of the interaction c (e.g.,“Scenario: 2 strangers are
meeting at a party. Participants: Eli Dawson and
William Brown”) along with the corresponding social goal g of the current acting agent (e.g., finding

agent-based simulations tend to generate more repetitive utterances.

In contrast, the finetuned model shows a relatively large improvement in the competitive scenarios. However, this does not necessarily mean that
the finetuned model is improving its negotiation

interaction style. Specifically, we calculate the percentage of the interactions that end in a successful purchase in the Craigslist task.11 We find that
the SCRIPT simulations reach a deal in 94% of
the interactions, while AGENTS simulations only
reach a deal in 30% of the interactions. Finetuning the model increases the percentage to 93%,
which indicates that models can easily follow this
overly agreeable style from SCRIPT simulations.
This explains the large improvement of finetuning
on SCRIPT simulations for competitive scenarios,
which is not due to learning the negotiation skills
but more likely due to learning the interaction style
from the SCRIPT simulations.
For the cooperative scenarios, we measure the
relative position of the mutual friend’s name mentioned in the conversation as a proxy for the information leakage. A value of 0 indicates the
name was mentioned at the start of the conversation, while a value of 1 indicates it was mentioned
at the end. SCRIPT mode results show an average first-mention location of 0.13, contrasting with
AGENTS mode, which has an average of 0.39. This
suggests that in SCRIPT mode, the mutual friend’s
name is ‘guessed’ almost immediately. The complete distribution is in Figure 12 in the Appendix.
This demonstrates a bias of SCRIPT mode exploit11We use GPT-4 to determine whether the interaction ends

ing its knowledge from the omniscient perspective
about the conversational participants. We find that
this strategy generalizes poorly to the setting where
models do not have ground truth access to their
interlocutor’s knowledge and goals (as shown in
Figure 6).
5 Conclusion & Discussion
We scrutinize recent advances in social simulation
by evaluating current approaches’ ability to generalize to settings that are closer to human interaction. Focusing on cooperation and competition
given information-asymmetric settings, we evaluate three modes of deploying LLMs based on past
approaches in the literature. We find that LLMs
continue to face challenges when operating in more
realistic AGENTS mode. Meanwhile, the simulations generated from the SCRIPT mode show biases
toward exploiting white box access to the participants early in the interaction. Furthermore, we find
that finetuning models on these generations improve selectively on a measure of goal completion
from Sotopia, but it also imbues the implausible
strategies from the ‘omniscient’ SCRIPT simulations into the student models, resulting in further
bias.
5.1 Limitations of Omniscient Simulation
We find that generating simulations from a single
LLM that has control over both sides results in
substantially higher goal completion rates. Human
conversation participants however, need to contend
with irreducible uncertainties that result from not
having access to the mental states of our interlocutors. Therefore, successful human interaction is
marked by the seamless navigation of this uncertainty (Hawkins et al., 2021; Pinker et al., 2008).
In §3.1, we find that the SCRIPT generated interactions achieve a much different sense of success
wherein agents having full access to their interlocutor’s knowledge abrasively shortcut the interaction
by directly exploiting this information. We find that
this leaves harmful artifacts in the data that limit
their application to training dialogue agents (§4)
and, presumably, their generalization performance
to interact with humans.
5.2 Recommendations for Reporting
One concrete outcome of our findings is the need
to report which mode simulations are conducted in.
As explored in this work, each of the approaches

strikes a different trade-off between successful interaction and psychological plausibility that might
be used for different applications. (e.g., in a setting
like Park et al. 2023 where the priority is sociological realism, AGENTS-based simulation should
be preferred to SCRIPT). Studies that generate interactions from LLMs should include an index of
information transparency allowed to the agents in
their simulations and justify their choice, as well
as evaluate different prompting strategies across
the information asymmetry continuum. However,
these important details of the simulation are often
not mentioned explicitly in the work (Park et al.,
2022; Li et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023). For example, determining which mode Park et al. (2023)
used required delving into the codebase, since they
did not report it in the paper.12 Overlooking these
details can lead to confusion and misinterpretation
of the results. Inspired by model cards (Mitchell
et al., 2019), we propose a “simulation card” for
social simulation and evaluation, as shown in Figure 7 in the Appendix. The fields in the report
include basic simulation details, such as intended
use and evaluation metrics, which not only increase
the transparency of the simulation but also facilitate
reproducibility (Magnusson et al., 2023). We hope
this can be a starting point for the community to
develop a more comprehensive reporting paradigm
for simulation methods and evaluation metrics.
5.3 Towards Better Simulations in More
Realistic Settings
As mentioned in §2, humans seamlessly overcome
information asymmetry to achieve goals (Clark,
1996; Hawkins et al., 2021). One promising model
of this behavior is that humans use an internal capacity to reason about the mental states of others (“theory of mind”, Premack and Woodruff
1978; Bartsch and Wellman 1995; Dennett 1978) to
maintain probabilistic expectations over the mental
states of conversational partners and use it to decide
how to act (Austin, 1975; Franke, 2009; Goodman
and Frank, 2016; Sumers et al., 2023b).
LLMs have shown some evidence of human-like
conversational ability but have also been shown to
demonstrate crucial differences (Parrish et al. 2021;
Hu et al. 2022; Hosseini et al. 2023; Ruis et al.
2023; i.a.). Our work highlights the weaknesses
of both SCRIPT and AGENTS modes in modeling
12We found the initial codebase used SCRIPT mode for
generating social interactions. See appendix C for the code
snippet.

this ability; while SCRIPT exploits direct access
to the goals of the agents it simulates, AGENTS
mode struggles to generate natural interactions or
achieve its goals. This indicates that LLMs struggle with processing contexts involving information
asymmetry (Kim et al., 2023b).
While it is plausible that future models will improve on one or both of these axes with increased
scale, current interaction simulation could benefit from structuring generations to provide models
with more human-like access to their interlocutor’s
mental state. One possible solution is meticulous
data curation to thwart models from exploiting shallow heuristics (Hong et al., 2023; Ulmer et al.,
2024). Another approach involves prompting language models to collaboratively construct an explicit text-based log of the shared conversational
context, as described by Stalnaker (2014).
Similarly, language models may benefit from
externalizing inferences about the mental states
of their partners intermittently throughout interactions (see also recent work that uses models from
computational cognitive science to scaffold LM
generations in related settings: (Lin et al., 2022;
Lipkin et al., 2023; Wong et al., 2023; Ying et al.,
2023; Sumers et al., 2023a); i.a.). Lastly, models
can be provided limited access to the ground truth
mental states of the partners, modeling the human
aptitude for successfully inferring this information.
6 Limitations and Ethical Considerations
We acknowledge several limitations and ethical
considerations in this work.
Machine-based Evaluation Our analysis of goal
completion rate is based on GPT-4 generated data.
Though not perfectly aligned with human judgment, as demonstrated in Zhou et al. (2024), such
analysis can provide insights into the nature of social interactions and a basic understanding of how
LLMs perform in those social scenarios on a system level (i.e., averaging across sufficient simulations). However, this could induce specific biases
and errors, such as skewing towards certain language styles (Saito et al., 2023) and making an
unreasonable judgment. Future research could explore the timing of bias emergence, its impact on
evaluations, and strategies for its mitigation. The
identification of biases in this context could additionally enhance researchers’ comprehension of
social biases in real-world scenarios (Zhou et al.,
2021). Nevertheless, it is a compelling direction for

future research to develop better-automated evaluation metrics for social simulations.
Promt Design Our work is built on the prompt
framework in (Zhou et al., 2024) to simulate social
interactions. The prompts contain multiple structured fields, such as the role of each agent, the goal
of the interaction, and the constraints on the interaction. We acknowledge that the prompt design may
not fully capture the complexity of human social
interactions, and switching to different simulation
frameworks with different prompt designs may lead
to variations in the results. However, the main goal
of this work is to reveal the challenges of realistically simulating social interactions with LLMs due
to information asymmetry. And such challenges
are likely to persist across different prompt designs.
Future work should explore how different prompt
designs affect the performance of LLMs in social
simulations.
Limited Coverage of Social Simulation Although scenarios from (Zhou et al., 2024) cover
a wide range of scenarios, capturing the full spectrum of social interactions is challenging. For example, the dataset does not include scenarios where
people are cooking together, or where people are
assembling furniture together. These scenarios are
purely cooperative and information sharing is crucial to the success of the task as MutualFriends.
Incorporating such scenarios into the dataset would
provide more evidence of the limitations of SCRIPT
simulations. Future work should explore incorporating more scenarios in a more systematic way.
We only consider English language scenarios for
the social simulation and it is not clear how well
the findings generalize to other languages or even
code-switching scenarios.
Considerations for Other Properties of Human Social Interactions Although AGENTS addresses several important aspects of human social
interactions, it abstracts away from other important aspects of human social interactions. For
example, AGENTS mode does not consider turntaking, which is crucial for human social interactions (Levinson, 2016). Although our work focuses on revealing the important difference between AGENTS and SCRIPT mode (e.g., information asymmetry), future work should consider other
important aspects of human social interactions,
such as turn-taking, multi-party interactions, memories, and asynchronous interactions.

Potential Risks of Social Simulation Attributing human characteristics to AI systems poses the
risk of anthropomorphizing them, potentially fostering over-reliance, susceptibility to manipulation,
and other negative influences (Deshpande et al.,
2023).
The main goal of this project is to examine and
reveal the limitations of simulating human social
interactions in the SCRIPT mode, and to provide
a better understanding of the social intelligence
of AI agents. We do not intend to create entities
indistinguishable from humans.
As models acquire the ability to persuade or negotiate with humans, concerns arise regarding the
potential for social manipulation or deception. We
discourage any intention to create manipulative
agents, and we will release our data under the AI2
impact license13 to safeguard against misuse. Subsequent research could dive deeper into the potential hazards of AI anthropomorphism and manipulation, and develop more resilient evaluation systems
to mitigate these risks.

CONTENT OF APPENDIX
In this paper, we integrate MINDREADERS and SCRIPT into the Sotopia framework, contrasting these
with AGENTS. We show that though interlocutors simulated omnisciently are much more successful at
accomplishing social goals and learning under such a setting greatly improves the conversation naturalness,
it does little help to improve the goal-reaching ability in cooperative scenarios. This highlights the
challenges of addressing information asymmetry for LLM-based agents. In the appendix, we provide the
following items that shed further insight into these contributions:
A Details for the Simulation Card, a valuable tool for reporting on social simulation platforms.
B The full prompts used in the model for AGENTS, MINDREADERS, and SCRIPT for an example.
C Example Code Snippets for Determining Simulation Modes.
D Full results across various metrics for the experiments mentioned in Figure 2 and Figure 5.
E Evaluation of dialogue naturalness between AGENTS and SCRIPT by human judges.
F Description of the simulation framework and models, including budget estimates.
G Additional analysis comparing different simulation modes.
H Additional information about prompts, including our attempts at refining prompts to enhance conversation naturalness, and how we construct prompts to judge how a deal is reached mentioned in
Section 4.4.
A Simulation Card
We propose a simulation card to report the details of social simulations and related platforms. The card
is designed to capture the essential information about the simulation, its intended use, metrics, ethical
considerations, and caveats and recommendations. The card is intended to be used as a reporting tool for
social simulations and related platforms. The card is presented in Figure 7.

Figure 9: The naturalness win rate between the SCRIPT and the AGENTS simulations as determined by human raters.
The average length of each turn in the interactions from the two modes is also shown (verbosity). We perform a
pairwise t-test, and * denotes statistical significance at p < 0.001.
E Human Evaluation for Naturalness
We recruit graduate student annotators to compare the naturalness of the simulations across different
modes. The annotators were presented with a pair of interactions and asked to select the more natural one.
Specifically, for each comparison, the annotators have access to the scenario, agens background, agents’
social goals, and the generated interactions. We ask “Which one sounds more like a natural interaction
that two people would have in this scenario? (simply note 1 or 2)”. The data collection procedure was
approved by our institution’s internal review board (IRB). And we compensate the annotators via gifts.
Annotators often find our task fun and the compensation satisfying. Before the annotation, we inform the
annotators that their demographic data will not be included in the collected data and the annotation will
only be used for assessing the naturalness of different simulation modes. All of our annotators are in US
and proficient in English. We have 5 female annotators and 4 male annotators in total.
For the MINDREADERS mode, we qualititively observe it shows similar pattern as the AGENTS mode.
We also calculate the verbosity (i.e., the average number of words per turn) of the MINDREADERS
simulations, which is 27.76 for GPT-3.5 and 31.96 for Mixtral-MoE.
For the finetuned AGENTS mode, we observe a big drop of the verbosity to 14.98, and the difference
in naturalness win rate between the SCRIPT and the AGENTS simulations not statistically significant
(p = 0.07) anymore (see Figure 9).
F Simulation and Finetuning Details
We use the sotopia platform to conduct the simulations. The platform is designed to facilitate the
generation of social interactions and the evaluation of the generated interactions. For the simulations
across different modes, we use 0.7 as the temperature for the GPT-3.5 model and Mixtral-MoE model. We
use the same temperature for the finetuned AGENTS mode as the original AGENTS mode. For evaluation,
we use temperature 0 for the GPT-4 model. We fix the verion of GPT-3.5 to gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and
the version of GPT-4 to gpt-4-0613 to increase the reproducibility of the results. For Mixtral-MoE, we
use the Together AI API (https://www.together.ai/). For the finetuning, we finetuned the GPT-3.5
with 1 epoch using the OpenAI API (https://platform.openai.com/finetune).
G Further Analysis for the Simulations across Modes
Figure 10 shows the information leakage (i.e., the relative first mention of the mutual friend’s name) in
the MutualFriends task. The lower the value suggests the earlier the mutual friend’s name is mentioned,

charaters in the simulations are more agreeable.
Figure 12 compares the distribution of when the first-mention of the mutual friend’s name (i.e.,
goal completion) occurs in the MutualFriends task. We observe a sharp contrast between the
