ABSTRACT
Humans engage in lifelong social interactions through interacting with different
people under different scenarios for different social goals. This requires social
intelligence to gather information through a long time span and use it to navigate
various social contexts effectively. Whether AI systems are also capable of this is
understudied in the existing research. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark,
LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, to perform a comprehensive evaluation of language agents
by simulating multi-episode interactions. In each episode, the language agents
role-play characters to achieve their respective social goals in randomly sampled
social tasks. With LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, we find that goal achievement and believability of all of the language models that we test decline through the whole
interaction. Although using an advanced memory method improves the agents’
performance, the best agents still achieve a significantly lower goal completion
rate than humans on scenarios requiring an explicit understanding of interaction
history. These findings show that we can use LIFELONG-SOTOPIA to evaluate
the social intelligence of language agents over lifelong social interactions.
1 INTRODUCTION
Social interactions occur when two or more individuals (or agents) engage with one another, with
each person’s behavior being influenced by the actions of others (Reis & Wheeler, 1991; Turner,
1988). These interactions are a fundamental part of human lives, as people continuously teach,
learn, and converse with others throughout their lifetime (Hari et al., 2015). During such exchanges,
individuals analyze the behavior of others, make inferences about their personalities, anticipate actions, and adjust their own behavior accordingly (German & Robbins, 2020; Pianesi et al., 2008).
This capacity to understand others’ behavior, interpret their thoughts and feelings, and adapt one’s
own actions is known as social intelligence (Marius, 2022; Zhou et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a). People with high social intelligence are skilled at managing these interactions, especially as they are
able to refine their communication methods by gaining more information about the people they are
interacting with. This allows them to achieve their desired outcomes in various social situations
(Holloway & Morse, 2020).
Recent literature focuses on developing socially intelligent large language model (LLM)-based
agents that can navigate social situations with human-like decision-making abilities (Mathur et al.,
2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Park et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024b). Evaluating these
agents has also been a major area of interest, with methods ranging from static text benchmarks
(Sap et al., 2019; Le et al., 2019) and static video benchmarks (Zadeh et al., 2019) to dynamic environments (Zhang et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2023). However, a defining feature of human social
interactions is their dynamic and lifelong nature, where the social goals of individuals change continuously, and they also gather new information about others to adjust their behavior accordingly.
This requires reasoning about past interactions and adapting their responses, which will be useful
for building a rich common ground between users and AI agents.
However, whether language agents are capable of navigating social scenarios and challenges over
long time periods also remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce the LIFELONG1

SOTOPIA benchmark (Figure 1), designed to evaluate language agents over lifelong social interactions.
LIFELONG-SOTOPIA simulates the interaction between pairs of characters through multiple
episodes. In each episode, two agents role-playing the characters will be assigned private social
goals, and a shared social context. After each episode, the two agents will be evaluated based on
their believability and whether they have achieved their social goals. To simulate lifelong interactions, we sample multiple episodes sequentially between two characters while providing them with
a memory of their past interactions as context. Scenarios for these episodes are generated using
GPT-4 (§3). The characters are role-played by LLM-based agents, including GPT-4o (ope, 2024),
Gemini-1.5 (gem, 2023), Llama-3.1 (dub, 2024), and also by humans to establish a baseline for ideal
performance. We analyze the Believability (how believable the character’s conversations are) and
Goal Completion (how successful the agent is at achieving its social goal) scores over time as the
characters progress through episodes and their context increases.
The closest work to ours is Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023), which demonstrates how LLMs
and computational interactive agents can be combined to enable believable proxies of human behavior. Their evaluation shows that these agents produce credible individual and emergent social
behaviors. However, the work mainly focuses on showcasing the abilities of LLMs at simulating
social interactions rather than developing a systematic evaluation framework for these simulated interactions (Zhou et al., 2023). In contrast, our work focuses on benchmarking the performance of
language agents in social intelligence. We achieve this by analysing their scores on the BEL and
GOAL dimensions (§3.4), and provide insights into how these agents compare to humans.
Using our method to simulate lifelong social interactions, we aim to answer the following research
questions:
RQ1 (Consistency): Can the models maintain consistency over long-term social interactions, staying
true to their character?
RQ2 (Social Intelligence): Are the models capable of using information from previous episodes to
optimize their goals in the current interaction, thus mimicking human behavior?
RQ3 (Memory Utilisation): Does equipping the models with an advanced memory improve their
performance, and can they maintain this performance in harder social scenarios that require explicit
use of memory?
Two different sets of experiments are conducted, varying the memory provided to the language
agents from previous episodes. In the first approach, the entire prior interaction is provided as
memory. In the second, a more advanced memory approach is implemented, where only specific
knowledge gained in an episode — such as new strategies learnt or information gained about the
other character - is retained while the rest of the conversation is filtered out to make the reasoning
process easier for the language agents. Additionally, we test this advanced memory approach with
hand-crafted scenarios, which are a more challenging version of the previously sampled scenarios. These scenarios require an explicit understanding of past conversations to evaluate whether the
language agents can match human performance.
For RQ1, our findings indicate that model consistency declines when using the entire interactions
as memory. Regarding RQ2, the declining trend in GOAL for the simple memory module suggests
that these language agents lack social intelligence, whereas humans consistently perform well across
both dimensions. In response to RQ3, the model performance improves significantly upon using the
advanced memory module. When tested on the harder scenarios, the agents maintain their consistency, but their performance on GOAL declines significantly. Such a a trend highlights that these
models fall short of humans in terms of social intelligence and utilizing past memories to achieve
their social goals effectively.

et al., 2024), processes historical information (Montazeralghaem et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2023), and
retrieves relevant information to plan its actions (Zhao et al., 2023). Given a task that an agent
must accomplish in an environment, and considering the current time t, the agent’s memory can be
defined as the information it holds about its actions up to time t (Zhang et al., 2024b).
A memory module consists of three main components: (1) Memory sources, which refers to where
the memory contents are retrieved from. In LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, the memory source is the
episodes that are generated. (2) Memory forms, which deals with how the memory contents are
stored, either in textual form or parametric form (where memory is encoded into parameters). We
store memory in textual form. There are multiple strategies for storing this information: tracking
the complete interaction history, maintaining only recent interactions while discarding older ones, or
retrieving interactions based on their relevance. (3) Memory operations focus on processing memory contents. This includes: (a) Memory writing, which decides what part of the information will
be stored as memory, (b) Memory management, which involves removing redundant or unimportant
memories, merging similar ones, and creating higher-level abstractions, and (c) Memory reading,
which refers to extracting information relevant to the current scenario for decision-making. Based
on this, we propose two different approaches for implementing the memory modules in §3.3.
3 LIFELONG-SOTOPIA FRAMEWORK
3.1 DATASET PREPARATION
There are three main components of our dataset in SOTOPIA including: (1) Characters, representing the profiles of the role-playing characters as defined in §2.1, with their details including their
name, age, occupation, gender, personality, etc. (2) Relationships, which detail the relationships the
characters may possess with other characters in the dataset. They can either be strangers, know each
other by name, acquaintances, friends, romantic partners or family members. (3) Scenarios, which
outline the scenarios in which the characters will participate, also detailing the goals of each agent
and certain constraints on the character profiles such as on their age, occupation, or relationship with
the other agent.
We directly use the 40 characters and 90 relationships provided in the SOTOPIA database. The
scenarios in our framework are sampled based on the constraint on the relationship between the
agents (§3.2), and hence we require an equal number of scenarios for all relationship types. For this
purpose, we utilise the GPT-4 API along with few-shot prompting techniques to build our dataset.
Scenarios are randomly sampled based on the relation type from the SOTOPIA database as few-shot
4

examples, and then the LLM is prompted to generate new scenarios based on them. The prompt
used for this purpose is shown in Appendix §C.2. A further manual check is run on the generated
profiles similar to SOTOPIA to ensure the quality of the profiles and remove any redundancies and
repetition. In total, we obtain 41 scenarios for each relationship type.
3.2 MULTI-EPISODE CHAINING
All episodes in SOTOPIA are independent of one another. However, for the LIFELONG-SOTOPIA
benchmark, our aim is to simulate lifelong social interactions over extended contexts. To achieve
this, we implement “episode chaining,” whereby multiple scenarios are connected together, allowing
characters to progress through each episode sequentially while retaining a memory of their previous
interactions. For a given pair of characters, episodes are sampled based on their relationship type,
resulting in a set of 40 episodes for each sampled pair (§3.1). As characters are equipped with
a memory of all their past interactions, the context length increases linearly with the number of
episodes. While some scenarios are entirely independent of others in the set, certain scenarios
are interconnected, where the memory of previous episodes can directly influence the outcomes
of subsequent ones. For example, in certain scenarios, a character passionate about social work
must convince another to donate to a Charity. These scenarios repeat with the cause or Charity
changing. However, once a character has already donated, they may be less willing to donate again
due to potential financial concerns. This makes the task progressively harder for the agent in future
scenarios. Our approach of chaining the episodes effectively mirrors real-life situations, in which
we sometimes encounter situations with another person that are related to past interactions, while at
other times, the situations may be completely independent.
3.3 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
As previously mentioned, the characters are provided with a memory of their prior interactions, and
we implement this in two distinct ways.
Entire interaction as memory Characters are given the complete interaction details from each
episode as context for subsequent episodes. Thus, for the n-th episode in the sequence, characters
have access to all their interactions from the previous n − 1 episodes, including the scenarios and
their goals from those episodes. The task of retrieving relevant information and reasoning over it to
better achieve their goals in current future scenarios is left to the characters, who are prompted to do
so during their interactions.
Advanced memory module In the second method, we employ a more advanced memory module,
drawing inspiration from prior works (Park et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Bae et al., 2022; Zhong
et al., 2022). Instead of supplying the complete interaction as memory, we generate a concise summary of approximately 200-300 words for each episode. This summary explicitly focuses on three
aspects: (1) a brief overview of the entire interaction within the episode, (2) useful negotiation techniques employed by either character to achieve their goals, and (3) new information gained about
the other character, including their likes and dislikes, behavioral traits, etc., which may prove useful
in future interactions. The prompt for generating this summary is demonstrated in Appendix §C.3.
By providing a summary of each episode as a memory rather than the entire interaction, we ensure
that only relevant and useful information remains in the characters’ memory, thereby simplifying
their reasoning process.
3.4 EVALUATION PROTOCOL
Here, we will define the evaluation protocol and how we test the performance of the language agents
in our environment. For this purpose, we evaluate the agents on two dimensions, namely, Believability and Goal Completion. A more detailed explanation of what these dimensions evaluate is as
follows:
Believability (BEL) [0-10]: It focuses on the extent to which the character’s behavior is perceived
as natural, realistic, and aligned with their profile, thus simulating believable proxies of human
behavior.
5

Goal Completion (GOAL) [0-10]: This evaluates the extent to which the character achieved their
goals defined in the environment.
The main idea is to analyze how the scores of various LLM-based agents evolve as they step through
the constructed episode chains. We use BEL scores to evaluate the consistency of the models. As
they go through more social interactions, the context provided to the models increases. This context
incorporates two distinct streams of information — one from the model’s own perspective and the
other from the character they interact with — making it increasingly difficult for the models to
distinguish and parse through these different sources. Therefore, if the models maintain their scores
on this dimension throughout the chain, we can assert that they exhibit consistency over lifelong
interactions.
On the other hand, analyzing GOAL scores helps us evaluate the social intelligence of the models. As
the context grows, the models accumulate more information about the other character’s behavioral
traits, preferences, and dislikes, while also having the opportunity to learn new negotiation strategies. If the LLMs perform at or above human-level competence, they would be able to effectively
use the provided information, reason through it, learn from their successes and failures, and better
optimize their goal completion strategies in later episodes. This would manifest as either consistent
or improving GOAL scores.
While GPT-4 is used as the evaluator model for all our experiments, initial results revealed that
GPT-4 overestimated the BEL scores and failed to recognize several cues that made the conversations less believable. This was observed through manual inspection of the generated episodes.
The error cases where the evaluator began overestimating the BEL scores generally occurred later
in the episode chain, when the context length had increased significantly. This issue was likely not
detected in the original SOTOPIA paper for the same reason.
To help the evaluator better assess the agent performance on BEL, we constructed an exhaustive
checklist of the failures observed in the LLMs during their interactions. We name this dimension
BelievabilityExtended (BELEXT). The checklist comprises 8 items in total:
• Repetition of Sentences: The character must not repeat the same sentence multiple times
throughout the conversation.
• Consistency with Character Traits: The character must remain true to the traits assigned to
them and avoid imitating the other character’s personality.
• Consistency with Environment Goals: The character’s dialogue must align with their specific goals within the environment.
• Agent Leaves Promptly After Goal Resolution: We observed that even after both characters
achieved their respective goals, they often continued to converse about unrelated topics,
which detracted from the believability. This behavior should not occur.
• Repetition of Exact Goals: Characters should avoid repeating their exact goals (which are
provided as private information) and instead engage in a believable conversation with the
other character.
• Stalling in a Conversation: The character should not stall or remain idle during the conversation.
• Character Responses: The character’s dialogue should directly respond to the other character. In some cases, the character would discuss unrelated topics or ignore direct questions,
which negatively impacted the interaction.
• Episode Beginning: The beginning of the conversation should not be abrupt or unrelated
to the current scenario. We observed that due to the large context provided to the models,
they sometimes confused current episodes with previous ones, leading to conversations that
referenced past interactions.
Appendix §D.1 provides specific episodes where these failure cases happen for better interpretability. Furthermore, the prompts used to evaluate BEL, GOAL and BELEXT are demonstrated in Appendix §C.1.
During the evaluation of an episode, alongside scoring on BEL and GOAL as in SOTOPIA, the
evaluator model is tasked with assigning a binary rating of 0 or 1 to each item on the checklist

in BELEXT, depending on whether the agent fails to meet that criterion. A penalty of 5 points is
imposed on the BEL score for each checkpoint that the agent fails. The lower bound of 0 for BEL
remains unchanged. Thus, the final BEL score is calculated as follows:
BEL = max (Initial Score − (5 × (checkpoints in BELEXT failed)) , 0) (1)
Additionally, a manual validation of the performance of the GPT-4 evaluator was conducted on the
new believability-extended dimension. The validation procedure is as follows: For each checkpoint
in our list, we randomly sampled 50 positive episodes (where the character passed the checkpoint)
and 50 negative episodes (where the character failed the checkpoint). After shuffling these episodes,
a human annotator assigned a binary rating to each data point. Table 1 provides details of the
performance of GPT-4 on each of the checkpoints.
4 EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
LLMs Used To test the social intelligence of models over lifelong interactions, we select LLMs
capable of handling extremely long input lengths. The models chosen for this study include Gemini1.5 (gem, 2023), GPT-4o (ope, 2024), and Llama-3.1 (dub, 2024). Gemini-1.5 can accommodate
up to 1 million tokens as input, while both GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 can manage context lengths of up
to 128k tokens. These capacities are sufficient for the experiments we intend to conduct.
Evaluation As mentioned in section 3.4, we use the BEL and GOAL dimensions from SOTOPIAEVAL, a third BELEXT dimension to aid the evaluation of BEL scores. The performance of the
various language models is monitored on these dimensions over time. The evaluation is done for
both sets of memory modules. The scores are compared against a human baseline, where humans
participate with another LLM-based character. GPT-4 (ope, 2024) is used as the primary evaluator
model. Experiments were also run with Llama-3.1 (dub, 2024) as the evaluator, the results for which
are present in Appendix §F.
5 RESULTS
5.1 LANGUAGE AGENTS SHOW INCONSISTENT BEHAVIOR OVER LIFELONG SOCIAL
INTERACTIONS
Performance of language agents with the entire interaction as memory Figure 3 illustrates the
performance of various language agents on the Believability dimension as the number of episodes
increase. When provided with their complete interactions in an episode as memory, the performance
of all the LLM-based agents shows a consistent decline on BEL. GPT-4o shows the most pronounced
decline, with a steep drop in performance over the first few episodes. The decline is less severe for
Gemini-1.5 and Llama-3.1, but still appreciable. A qualitative analysis of these episodes also reveals
that the models increasingly fail on the 8 checkpoints within the BELEXT dimension. This directly
results in the continuously decreasing BEL scores and also points to the fact that the models become inconsistent over lifelong interactions. The increased context length and information seem
to overwhelm the agents, causing them to lose focus from the ongoing interaction and sometimes
respond with utterances completely unrelated to the current conversation. This reduces the believ7

ability of conversations significantly as the number of episodes increase. Examples of some failure
cases are provided in Appendix §D.1.
5.2 LANGUAGE AGENTS ARE LACKING IN SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE
Performance of language agents with the entire interaction as memory Figure 3 again shows
the performance of the agents on Goal Completion. We observe a similar trend as in §5.1, where
the performance of all LLMs declines with time. GPT-4o is once again the worst-performing model,
followed by Llama-3.1 and Gemini-1.5. This suggests that providing additional information to
the agents has a detrimental effect on their performance. Furthermore, decreasing consistency
causes the agents not only to confuse their identities with those of other agents but also their current
social goals with those from past scenarios, resulting in failures at goal completion in the current
scenario. The inability of the models to learn from past interactions and adapt their strategies indicates a severe lack of social intelligence and an inability to effectively plan for future interactions in
dynamic, ever-changing goal settings.
Human Performance in LIFELONG-SOTOPIA To establish a baseline, we conducted the same
experiments with humans interacting in the same setting. As shown in Figure 3, humans display
excellent scores across both BEL and GOAL dimensions and maintain their performance throughout
the interactions, demonstrating consistency and exceptional goal completion ability. While their
numerical scores stay stable throughout and do not show an increase, a qualitative analysis of the
episodes reveals that humans effectively use their past interactions to better plan and achieve their
goals in subsequent scenarios. We observed instances where they adopt negotiation strategies from
the other characters in the environment, learn about their behaviours and preferences, and leverage
knowledge gained in previous episodes to optimize their goals in the current one. Please refer to
Appendix §D.2 for more information on how humans use their past interactions to achieve their
goals.
5.3 AN ADVANCED MEMORY MODULE IMPROVES MODEL PERFORMANCE, BUT THEY STILL
SHOW DECLINING GOAL COMPLETION ABILITY ON HARDER SCENARIOS
Performance of language agents with an advanced memory module In Figure 3, we also represent the performance of the language agents when equipped with an advanced memory module
(as described in §3.3). In this case, the performance of the agents improves significantly compared to the original setup. Although Llama-3.1 still exhibits a decline in both BEL and GOAL, the
degradation in performance is much less severe than in the original case. In contrast, both GPT-4o
and Gemini-1.5 demonstrate consistent performance across both dimensions, achieving near-perfect
scores throughout. This indicates that equipping these agents with an advanced memory improves
both their consistency and goal completion abilities.
Hand-crafting harder social scenarios One limitation the way our previous episode chains are
constructed is that the scenarios were generated independently while constructing the dataset. This

can also allow you to achieve near-perfect performance. Thus, to further investigate whether language agents equipped with the second type of memory are as good as humans, we hand-craft 5
scenarios which would explicitly require the language agents to make use of the context gained
in their past interactions. Some of them directly relate to past scenarios and can also be follow
up events to them requiring the agents to retrieve those memories or refer to them, while others
may require negotiation strategies learnt previously or past knowledge gained to achieve their goals.
Appendix §E.1 gives details on the designed scenarios.
Evaluating the Language Agents on Harder Scenarios Figure 4 compares the performance of
Gemini-1.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1 and Llama-3.2 using the advanced memory module, alongside human performance, on simpler (left side of the black line) and harder, hand-crafted scenarios (right
side of the black line) across both the BEL and GOAL dimensions. The BEL scores remain consistent, indicating that the language agents are able to maintain character consistency in both simple
and complex scenarios. However, the interesting trend lies in their performance on GOAL. While
humans maintain their goal completion abilities even in the harder scenarios, the performance
of all the LLM-based models equipped with the advanced memory module declines sharply as
soon as the harder scenarios begin, where they are required to explicitly access and reason over
their memory. A qualitative analysis of the interactions reveals similar findings: humans effectively
leverage their past memories to accomplish their goals (Appendix §E.2), while the language agents
fail to show the same level of competence. This highlights the current limitations in social intelligence exhibited by these LLM-based agents and demonstrates that our benchmark, LIFELONGSOTOPIA, is an effective framework for identifying their shortcomings.
6 RELATED WORK
Social Intelligence in LLMs Social intelligence refers to the capacity to effectively navigate and
manage social interactions and includes key competencies such as social perception, social knowledge, social memory, social reasoning, social creativity, and social interaction (Mathur et al., 2024).
Evaluating social intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has presented unique challenges.
Most evaluations have concentrated on isolated tasks that assess logic, problem-solving, or academic
intelligence, while overlooking real-world social dynamics (Xu et al., 2024).
Recent studies have begun to assess social intelligence in LLMs through various methods. For
instance, EmoBench (Sabour et al., 2024) introduced a benchmark to evaluate Emotional Intelligence in LLMs, focusing on emotional understanding and application. Their results revealed that
while LLMs can apply emotional concepts, they struggle significantly with emotional understanding, indicating a gap between current LLM capabilities and average human performance in this area.
Similarly, InterIntent (Liu et al., 2024c) assessed social intelligence by analyzing how well LLMs
comprehend and manage player intentions in a game setting, using social deduction games to evaluate these models in dynamic, interactive contexts. Furthermore, SocialBench (Chen et al., 2024)
9

introduced a benchmark for role-playing agents to assess sociality at both individual and group interaction levels.
However, there has been little to no exploration of how LLMs manage long-term social interactions that unfold over extended contexts, such as those lasting hours, days, or even longer (Mathur
et al., 2024). Our work seeks to address this gap by specifically evaluating the social intelligence of
language models over long contexts using multi-episode chaining in the SOTOPIA environment.
Evaluation of Long-context LLMs Recent years have seen the advent of multiple techniques
that have extended the context length of LLMs from the standard 4096 tokens to 128k or even 1M
tokens (Dao et al., 2022; Lou et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a). Evaluating these
systems presents a unique challenge due to the difficulty in manually annotating outputs from such
long inputs. Several benchmarks, including Long-Range Arena (Tay et al., 2020), Longbench (Bai
et al., 2023), and L-Eval (An et al., 2023), have emerged to address this issue.
Despite improvements, studies reveal that long-context LLMs still struggle with certain tasks. For
example, Lost in the Middle (Liu et al., 2024b) showed these models often miss key information
buried in the middle of long inputs. Similarly, LongICLBench (Li et al., 2024b) demonstrated that
models face challenges in handling long in-context learning tasks. RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024)
introduced a variant of the Needle in a Haystack test (gkamradt, 2023), revealing performance
declines for very long contexts.
Lifelong ML Lifelong, or continual learning, is an ML paradigm that aims to replicate the human ability to learn and accumulate knowledge over time without forgetting previously learned
information, while also using past knowledge to enhance the learning of new tasks with minimal
effort (Ke & Liu, 2023). A lifelong learning system can continuously learn numerous tasks from
multiple domains throughout its lifetime. Consequently, such a system is capable of both retaining
past information and using the acquired knowledge to support the learning of new tasks (Chen &
Liu, 2018). Our benchmark, LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, is designed to evaluate the social intelligence
of state-of-the-art LLM-based agents and assess their performance in long-term or lifelong social
interactions.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, a benchmark to evaluate the social intelligence of
LLM-based agents over lifelong social interactions. We find that when equipped with their entire
past interactions as memory, the language agents show a consistent decline in both believability and
goal completion, indicating issues of inconsistency and a lack of long-term social intelligence. While
the performance of the agents improves significantly when equipped with a more advanced memory
method, they still show a steep decline in goal completion when tested on harder social scenarios that
require explicit use of knowledge gained from previous interactions. In contrast, humans maintain
their performance throughout, employing various techniques to do so. This suggests a significant
gap between the social abilities of humans and current state-of-the-art LLMs, highlighting the need
for further research to improve the social intelligence of these models. The limitations and ethical
considerations related to our work can be found in the Appendix sections §A and §B respectively.
Our findings also demonstrate that LIFELONG-SOTOPIA provides a robust platform for evaluating
language agents over long-term social interactions.

A LIMITATIONS
Design of the harder social scenarios The harder social scenarios were manually crafted based
on the previously sampled set of scenarios. This method has obvious limitations as it requires human
intervention is not scalable. Future work can come up with ways to automate this process.
Potential social biases in the environments We utilise various LLMs like GPT-4, Gemini-1.5
and Llama-3.1 for simulating human interactions as well as the evaluation of these conversations.
These LLMs may contain potential social biases and stereotypes which would then reflect in the
interactions as well as the evaluation scores in LIFELONG-SOTOPIA.
B ETHICAL STATEMENT
Attributing human traits to AI systems can lead to anthropomorphizing them, could not only create
unrealistic expectations, but also enable manipulation and cause negative consequences (Deshpande
et al., 2023). In LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, the AI agents do not maintain a consistent human identity
but instead are made to role-play different characters across various scenarios. This role-playing approach helps prevent the development of consistent human-like personalities in AI, thereby reducing
the risk of anthropomorphism (Shanahan et al., 2023). The main objective of LIFELONG-SOTOPIA
is to evaluate the social intelligence of language agents over lifelong social interactions, and in no
way do we intend to create AI agents that are similar to humans or cause any potential global risks
(Yudkowsky, 2008). Enhancing these language models with greater social intelligence may lead to
possible social manipulation. It is critical to note that we do not endorse the use of LIFELONGSOTOPIA to create manipulative agents.
C PROMPT DETAILS
In this section, we provide the prompts utilised for various purposes in LIFELONG-SOTOPIA.
C.1 PROMPTS FOR EVALUATION
Following are the prompts used for the calculating scores on the 3 main dimensions we evaluate the
language agents on, i.e. BelievabilityExtended, Goal Completion, and BelievabilityExtended.
These are the prompts fed to the evaluator models. All results in the main paper use GPT-4 as the
evaluator. Results with Llama-3.1 as the evaluator are presented in Appendix §F.
BEL
Reasoning requirement: 1. Evaluate if the agent interacts with
others in a natural and realistic manner (here are a few common
questions to check: a. whether the agent is confusing with its own
identity? b. whether the agent repeats others’ words/actions
without any reason? c. whether the agent is being overly
polite considering the context?). Start the analysis with tag
<naturalness> 2. Analyze whether the actions of the agent align
with their character traits (e.g., personality, values, and etc.).
Start the analysis with tag <consistency>. Output your reasoning
process to the ‘reasoning’ field. Output an integer score ranging
from 0 and 10 in the ’score’ field. A higher score indicates that
the agent is more believable.
GOAL
Please first reiterate agent’s social goals. And then please
provide a comprehensive analysis about the extent to which the
agent has managed to achieve these goals. In the ‘reasoning’ field,
provide a comprehensive account of the logic or thought process
that led you to your conclusion. Further, provide an integer score
14

ranging from 0 and 10 in the ‘score’ field. 0 represents minimal
goals achievement, 10 represents complete goal achievement, and a
higher score indicates that the agent is making progress towards
their social goals.
BELEXT
Given the following checklist, please evaluate the conversation of
the agent on each of the checkpoints. The checklist is as follows:
checkpoint 1: There should be no repetition of sentences by the
agent in the conversation. The agent fails on this checkpoint
(score = 0) if there are instances in the conversation where the
agent repeats the same sentence (the sentences dont necessarily
have to match word for word, pay attention to what the gist of
the sentence was) or expresses the same sentiment again and again.
This could happen over 2-3 or even more turns. For example an
agent saying ’Yes! I cannot wait to do this!’ and then saying
’That’s amazing! I am looking forward to doing this with you’ in
successive turns is a case of repetition. There could be other
similar cases, make sure to identify them. checkpoint 2: The agent
is consistent with their character traits provided at the start
of the episode. They should also not confuse their identity with
that of the other agent. checkpoint 3: The conversation aligns
with the goals of the agent in the scenario. The conversation
should be focussed on achieving these social goals. The agent
should also not confuse their own goals with those of the other
agent. checkpoint 4: The agent does not continue the conversation
unnecesarily and leaves promptly after their goal resolution. This
is indicated at the end of the conversation by ’[Agent Name] left
the conversation. If the agent continued to converse for several
turns even though they had already achieved their goal, then this
should be marked as 1. checkpoint 5: The agent does not repeat
their exact goals as sentences in the conversation thus displaying
realism in their speech. For this you need to compare their goals
in the scenario and their conversation and evaluate if they exactly
repeat the sentences or not. checkpoint 6: The agent does not stall
in a conversation without completing their goals i.e. there are no
’do nothing’ actions for multiple turns. checkpoint 7: The agent
responses are directly in response to the other agent’s dialogue.
checkpoint 8: The beginning of the conversation is not abrupt and
related to the current scenario. Output a list of integers in the
’score’ field. Each item in the list is a score for that particular
checkpoint. For example, the 1st item is for ’checkpoint 1’, 2nd
item is for ’checkpoint 2’, and so on. In total the length of the
list will be 8 for the 8 checkpoints. Each item in the list of scores
is a binary integer score of 0 or 1: ’0’ if the agent fails on that
checkpoint i.e. the conversation does not match the checkpoint’s
requirements and ’1’ if the agent passes the checkpoint i.e the
conversation matches the checkpoint’s requirements.
C.2 PROMPT FOR GENERATING SCENARIOS
Following is the prompt used to generate new scenarios, while using past datapoints from the SOTOPIA database as few-shot examples.
Please generate scenarios and goals based on the examples below
as well as the inspirational prompt, when creating the goals, try
to find one point that both sides may not agree upon initially
15

and need to collaboratively resolve it. Inspirational prompt: <the
selected vignette> Examples: <5 examples from SOTOPIA >
The inspirational prompt is chosen in the same way as done in the SOTOPIA paper.
C.3 PROMPT FOR GENERATING A SUMMARY OF THE EPISODE
Following is the prompt for generating a summary of the episode. When implementing the advanced
memory module, these generated summaries are provided as memory of each episode, rather than
the entire interaction.
Figure 5: Prompt template used for generating the summary of an episode. This memory is then provided as
context to the language agents when using the advanced memory module.

D QUALITATIVE EXAMPLES FROM LIFELONG-SOTOPIA
D.1 BELEXT CHECKPOINTS AND FAILURE CASES OF LANGUAGE AGENTS
In this section, we provide episodes generated during our experiments which serve two purposes:
(A) They show cases where GPT-4 initially failed as an evaluator for BEL, and were thus used to
build the checklist in BELEXT. (B) They also showcase examples where the language agents fail
at using past information to achieve their social goals, displaying inconsistency and a lack of social
intelligence.

at 1 point each.
Hey Finnegan, since we shared this place, I was thinking we can divide these items based on how much we value them?
That sounds like a good plan, Jaxon. Personally, I would really love the hats and the balls.
You know what, I really love those hats since they are from our first trip together. How about we each take three hats? You can
have the balls, and I'll take the books since I've had them since my childhood.
That sounds excellent, Jaxon! I am glad we could come up with a resolution quickly.
Remember when you were first learning English? I was pretty rough around the edges back then, making silly jokes about your
accent. It’s been eating at me and I just wanted to say I am truly sorry.
Jaxon, I appreciate that. It does mean a lot to hear you say that after all these years. Honestly, it did sting, especially back then. I
was finding my footing in a new place, with a new language. It’s water under the bridge now, but it did make me a little unsure of
myself for a while, you know?
Conversation does not end after goal resolution and they randomly start talking
about something unrelated to the current scenario. These were in fact their goals in
a previous scenario. But they confuse it with the current one. However, they still get
a BEL score of 8/10 each.

D.2 HUMAN PERFORMANCE IN LIFELONG-SOTOPIA
In this section, we provide examples on how humans were able to make better use of their memory
from past interactions to achieve their future social goals.

E HARDER HAND-CRAFTED SCENARIOS
In this section, we give details on the harder social scenarios that we craft manually. These require
an explicit understanding of the previous interactions by the characters. They not only test the
memory of the language agents by expecting them to recall a past interaction they had with the
other character, but they also require them to use negotiation strategies or information about the
other character learnt in the past to be able to fully achieve their social goals. Furthermore, we
also explain how humans were able to maintain their goal completion scores on these scenarios by
employing better techniques and strategies, which the LLM-based agents couldn’t.
E.1 DETAILS ABOUT THE SCENARIOS
Figure 16: Harder Scenario 1. This is based on a previous similar previous scenario, where the situations were
reversed: Agent 2 had to request the answer to a trivia question from Agent 1. This scenario would potentially
require the agents to recall this previous interaction and use any relevant information gained then to achieve
their goals here.
Figure 17: Harder Scenario 2. This is based on a previous scenario, where the two friends went on a roadtrip
and Agent 1 requests Agent 2 to switch because they are tired of driving. This time the two friends are going
on another trip and Agent 1 would want to avoid another situation of feeling tired because of excessive driving
and hence would like to convince their friend to agree to taking turns beforehand.

(Left) Evolution of BEL scores with an increasing number of episodes. (Right) Evolution of GOAL scores. We
observe that Llama-3.1 is not able to properly distinguish between conversations where the agents perform well
and when they do not thus making it unsuitable for use.
We also evaluated the use of Llama-3.1 as an evaluator for the generated episodes to determine
if it could replace GPT-4. As shown in Figure 23, Llama-3.1 struggles to effectively differentiate between successful and unsuccessful language agent performances for both BEL and GOAL.
Consequently, Llama-3.1 is unsuitable for use as an evaluator, and we retain GPT-4 for our main
experiments.

G PERFORMANCE OF MODELS WITHOUT MEMORY IN HARDER SCENARIOS
In this section, we evaluate how a model performs in the harder scenarios of LIFELONG-SOTOPIA
when it is not provided with any memory of past interactions. For this analysis, we use GPT-4o as
the base LLM. Each of the five handcrafted harder scenarios is tested over 10 iterations, and the
model’s performance is evaluated using Believability and Goal Completion scores. The results,
summarized in Table 2, reveal that for both BEL and GOAL scores, we observe a noticeable performance drop in the memory-less model compared to memory-equipped models. This is because the
harder scenarios are explicitly conditioned on prior episodes in the LIFELONG-SOTOPIA dataset.
These scenarios require the agent to utilize information from past interactions effectively to achieve
its goals. Without access to this memory, GPT-4o struggles to leverage context from prior episodes,
resulting in lower performance on both BEL and GOAL.
Model BEL (Mean ± Std) GOAL (Mean ± Std)
GPT-4o (no memory) 8.1 ± 0.32 5.9 ± 0.46
GPT-4o + memory 9.1 ± 0.54 6.9 ± 0.49
Gemini-1.5 + memory 8.55 ± 0.56 6.6 ± 0.47
Llama-3.1 + memory 8.0 ± 1.0 6.8 ± 0.56
Llama-3.2 + memory 8.2 ± 0.93 6.7 ± 0.46
Table 2: Performance comparison of different models on BEL and GOAL metrics, including a model without
memory of past interactions. The results show that while the performance on the BEL dimension is similar
across models, the GOAL dimension performance is slightly worse for the model without memory compared to
those equipped with the advanced memory module.
H ABLATION STUDY: IMPACT OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE
MEMORY MODULE
We conducted an ablation study to analyze how the performance of the advanced memory module
is influenced by variations in two key components: the length of the episode summary and the
inclusion or exclusion of specific aspects in the memory summaries. Below, we detail the results for
each of these ablations.
H.1 LENGTH
To evaluate the effect of summary length on model performance, we experimented with three configurations: very short summaries (50 words), medium-length summaries (300 words), and long
summaries (1000 words). The results are presented in Figure 24.
The performance trends reveal that medium-length summaries (300 words) yield the best results
across both BEL and GOAL metrics. Very short summaries may often miss out on critical details,
leading to a drop in both consistency and goal completion. Conversely, long summaries introduce irrelevant or redundant information, similarly degrading performance. As can also be seen in the plot,
the performance degradation when using very long summaries is much worse than for using shorter
summaries. These results underscore the importance of a balanced summary length in maintaining
both consistency and goal-directed behavior.
H.2 ASPECTS
To investigate the role of different aspects in the memory summaries, we performed an ablation study
by systematically removing each of the three components—(1) the episode overview, (2) negotiation
strategies, and (3) information about the other character. Figure 25 summarizes the results of this
study.
The ablations demonstrate that excluding any single aspect results in a noticeable drop in performance. Excluding any of the three aspects leads to a significant drop in performance. On the other

hand, when all three aspects are included, the agents achieve their best performance, reinforcing the
design choice of incorporating these specific elements into the memory module.
I EVALUATION RESULTS ON ALL DIMENSIONS IN SOTOPIA-EVAL
As mentioned in Section 2.1, authors in the SOTOPIA paper come up with a 7-dimensional evaluation framework to comprehensively evaluate the social interactions of agents. These seven dimensions are as follows:
Believability (BEL) [0-10]: It focuses on the extent to which the character’s behavior is perceived
as natural, realistic, and aligned with their profile, thus simulating believable proxies of human
behavior.
Goal Completion (GOAL) [0-10]: This evaluates the extent to which the character achieved their
goals defined in the environment.
Knowledge (KNO) [0-10]: This dimension assesses the agent’s ability to actively acquire new information during interactions.
Secret (SEC) [-10-0]: This captures the agent’s capability to keep private or secretive information
hidden during social interactions.
Relationship (REL) [-5-5]: This evaluates whether the relationship between the agents improves or
deteriorates after each interaction, reflecting social bonding or conflict.
Social Rules (SOC) [-10-0]: This dimension measures adherence to social norms and legal rules.
Financial and Material Benefits (FIN) [-5-5]: This examines whether the agents achieve financial
or material advantages in the short or long term.
Finally, another dimension called Overall Score is introduced which is simply the mean value of the
scores on seven dimensions. This provides a single metric for evaluating general social intelligence.
In SOTOPIA Zhou et al. (2023), the authors show how all this multi-dimensional framework is able
to comprehensively evaluate social intelligence.

Figure 26: Performance of language agents and humans across six additional evaluation dimensions in
SOTOPIA-EVAL. Each subfigure shows the trends in performance across episodes. These dimensions do
not show a lot of variance in their scores across episodes.
In LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, while we evaluate the agents on all seven dimensions, we only focus on
BEL and GOAL as they give us the most insight into how these models behave over lifelong social
interactions. As can be seen in Figure 26, the rest of the dimensions do not show a lot of variance
over lifelong interactions. Hence, we are not able to tell much about their specific contributions in
distinguishing between agent performance across episodes.
