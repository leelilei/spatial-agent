## Extracted Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have shown emerging potential in spatiotemporal reasoning, making them promising candidates for building urban agents that support diverse urban downstream applications. Despite these benefits, existing studies primarily focus on evaluating urban LLM agent on outcome-level metrics (e.g., prediction accuracy, traffic efficiency), offering limited insight into their underlying reasoning processes. As a result, the strengths and limitations of urban LLM agents in spatiotemporal reasoning remain poorly understood. To this end, we introduce USTBench, the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs’ spatiotemporal reasoning abilities as urban agents across four decomposed dimensions: spatiotemporal understanding, forecasting, planning, and reflection with feedback. Specifically, USTBench supports five diverse urban decision-making and four spatiotemporal prediction tasks, all running within our constructed interactive city environment UAgentEnv. The benchmark includes 62,466 structured QA pairs for process-level evaluation and standardized end-to-end task assessments, enabling fine-grained diagnostics and broad task-level comparison across diverse urban scenarios. Through extensive evaluation of thirteen leading LLMs, we reveal that although LLMs show promising potential across various urban downstream tasks, they still struggle in long-horizon planning and reflective adaptation in dynamic urban contexts. Notably, recent advanced reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) trained on general logic or mathematical problems do not consistently outperform non-reasoning LLMs. This discrepancy highlights the need for domain-specialized adaptation methods to enhance urban spatiotemporal reasoning.

Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have shown emerging potential in spatiotemporal reasoning, making them promising candidates for building urban agents that
support diverse urban downstream applications. Despite these benefits, existing
studies primarily focus on evaluating urban LLM agent on outcome-level metrics
(e.g., prediction accuracy, traffic efficiency), offering limited insight into their
underlying reasoning processes. As a result, the strengths and limitations of urban LLM agents in spatiotemporal reasoning remain poorly understood. To this
end, we introduce USTBench, the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs’ spatiotemporal reasoning abilities as urban agents across four decomposed dimensions:
spatiotemporal understanding, forecasting, planning, and reflection with feedback. Specifically, USTBench supports five diverse urban decision-making and
four spatiotemporal prediction tasks, all running within our constructed interactive city environment UAgentEnv. The benchmark includes 62,466 structured
QA pairs for process-level evaluation and standardized end-to-end task assessments, enabling fine-grained diagnostics and broad task-level comparison across
diverse urban scenarios. Through extensive evaluation of thirteen leading LLMs,
we reveal that although LLMs show promising potential across various urban
downstream tasks, they still struggle in long-horizon planning and reflective adaptation in dynamic urban contexts. Notably, recent advanced reasoning models
(e.g., DeepSeek-R1) trained on general logic or mathematical problems do not
consistently outperform non-reasoning LLMs. This discrepancy highlights the
need for domain-specialized adaptation methods to enhance urban spatiotemporal
reasoning. Overall, USTBench provides a foundation to build more adaptive and
effective LLM-based urban agents and broad smart city applications. Our project

1 Introduction
Urban systems are inherently complex and dynamic, characterized by continuous fluctuations across
space and time. By learning from large-scale spatiotemporal data, traditional data-driven methods
have achieved progress in prediction and decision support [1, 68, 46, 54, 45]. However, they often fall
short in generalizing to unseen scenarios and providing transparent reasoning for reliable decisionmaking [26, 21]. Recently, the advanced large language models (LLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o [18] and
DeepSeek-R1 [15]) have emerged as intelligent urban agents [21, 26, 75, 35, 36] due to their growing
reasoning ability to integrate diverse information, adapt across tasks, and offer detailed interpretation
through natural language. To fully leverage their potential, it is essential to systematically evaluate
LLMs’ spatiotemporal reasoning abilities: the capacity to infer spatiotemporal dynamics and interact
with evolving urban environments. Such evaluation is key to understanding their readiness for
real-world urban challenges.

In recent literature, many efforts have been made
to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning ability
of LLMs as urban agents. However, as summarized in Table 1, they have two limitations:
(1) Reliance on outcome-based metrics: solving
urban tasks requires multi-step reasoning, yet
existing studies [10, 11] only assess outcomebased metrics (e.g., prediction accuracy, traffic efficiency), overlooking intermediate reasoning steps. Their evaluations may mask critical
reasoning deficits. For instance, the reasoning
LLM, DeepSeek-R1, typically surpasses nonreasoning models. However, as shown in Figure 1, it slightly underperforms Llama3.3 in
outcome-based metrics of congestion prediction.

form downstream task evaluation across diverse urban scenarios and tasks. (3) Despite the promising
capability discovered by prior works, our extensive experiments in USTBench reveal several limitations of LLMs. The key findings include: As illustrated in Figure 2, LLMs excels in spatiotemporal
understanding and forecasting, but typically struggles in long-term action planning and reflection;
Reasoning models trained on general logical or mathematical tasks do not consistently outperform
non-reasoning models, underscoring the need for domain-specialized training; Planning emerges as a
higher-order ability that LLMs struggle with, which builds upon and extends beyond understanding
and forecasting; Reflection is critical for adaptability in dynamic urban contexts, while even the
leading reasoning LLMs struggle to learn from environmental feedback.
2 Preliminary
This work studies the spatiotemporal reasoning abilities of LLMs as urban agents, spanning decisionmaking and prediction tasks. Here, we provide background knowledge and important definitions.
Problem 1. Urban Decision-Making Tasks: Given an urban environment and a task t, an agent
operates based on urban observations o with a policy π(o) that determines a sequence of decisions
{a , a , ..., a } to manipulate the environment. The objective is to accomplish a target goal specified
0 1 n
by t (e.g., optimizing traffic flow by traffic signal control).
Problem 2. Urban Prediction Tasks: Given historical spatiotemporal observations o of an urban
i
environment, the goal of prediction is to anticipate urban future states {s , . . . , s } over a
i+1 i+∆
horizon ∆, where each state s captures key indicators (e.g., traffic volume) across space and time.
i
Definition 1. Urban LLM Agents: An urban LLM agent is a large language model-driven autonomous system designed to operate in dynamic urban environments. Formally, we define the urban
environment as E = ⟨S, A, O, T ⟩, where S states urban state space, A denotes the agent’s action
space, O is the observation space, and T : S × A → S is the environment’s transition function. At
each time step i, given a task t, the agent receives the current observation o ∈ O (e.g., local traffic
i
conditions), along with a history of prior observations o and actions a . Based on this context,
i−1 i−1
the agent performs reasoning to either (1) execute an action a ∈ A (e.g., activate a traffic signal), or
i
(2) generate predictions of future urban states {s , . . . , s } ⊂ S (e.g., estimated traffic volume).

Definition 2. Urban Spatiotemporal Reasoning: Urban spatiotemporal reasoning is the capability
of an LLM-based agent to interpret, act upon, and adapt to urban environments characterized by spatial
and temporal dynamics. Formally, given a task t and spatiotemporal observation o , it involves: (1)

3 UAgentEnv: Interactive City Environment
3.1 Urban Task Suite and Data Sources
Urban Tasks: UAgentEnv supports nine representative urban tasks across prediction and decisionmaking. The prediction tasks include next POI prediction [68], congestion forecasting [6], socioeconomic indicator prediction [28], and traffic origin-destination (OD) prediction [62]. The decisionmaking tasks cover traffic signal control [54], POI placement [48], route planning [24], road planning
[73], and urban planning [71]. Detailed descriptions are provided in Appendix E.1.
Urban Data Collection: To ensure UAgentEnv reflects real-world urban dynamics, we integrate
diverse publicly available datasets across five dimensions: (1) Geospatial Data: We incorporate
geospatial data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) [37], including points of interest (POIs), areas of interest
(AOIs), and road networks. (2) Traffic: Historical traffic flow data from multiple metropolitan areas
in China [6, 66] are used to simulate realistic traffic conditions. (3) Socio-economy: We include
time-series data on GDP and population trends in Guangzhou (2000–2019), sourced from [50] and
WorldPop [57], to model urban evolution. (4) Human mobility: Taxi trajectory data from New York
City [34] capture fine-grained human movement between urban regions. (5) POI check-ins: Check-in
records from the FourSquare dataset [51] capturing individuals transition between POIs over time.

3.2 Unified Urban Agent Framework
We introduce a unified framework for urban tasks, where the urban agent interacts with the environment across nine real-world tasks. To ensure consistency, we standardize task instructions, inputs,
outputs, and execution flows using simplistic instructions to showcase LLM basic reasoning abilities.
As shown in Figure 3, the framework follows a structured pipeline: (1) Each task provides the
agent with a description, data schema, and relevant domain knowledge. (2) The real-time urban
spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g.,, traffic condition, road configurations) are delivered to the agent as
contextual observations. (3) The LLM agent reasons to solve the task through a modular reasoning
workflow comprising spatiotemporal understanding, forecasting, and planning. Then, an action
or prediction is generated, aligning with the task objective and relevant past experiences retrieved
from memory. (4) After receiving environmental feedback (e.g., improved traffic efficiency) on the
previous output, the agent engages in reflection to evaluate its performance and diagnose errors. Then,
an informative experience will be generated and stored in the memory to guide future reasoning
processes. The prompt templates are detailed in Appendix E.3.
4 USTBench: Urban Spatiotemporal Reasoning Benchmark
4.1 Process-based Spatiotemporal Reasoning Evaluation
Previous evaluations of LLMs in urban tasks primarily rely on coarse, outcome-based metrics (e.g.,
prediction accuracy or traffic efficiency), which obscure critical reasoning deficits in reasoning
abilities. Alternatively, we propose a fine-grained assessment by decomposing spatiotemporal
reasoning into four key processes: spatiotemporal understanding, forecasting, planning, and reflection
with feedback. These processes are uniformly assessed via structured QA collected from UAgentEnv.
USTBench includes 62,466 QA instances across diverse urban scenarios, with performance measured
by accuracy. Statistics and examples are shown in Table 2, with details provided in Appendix G.4.3.

4.1.1 Observation Construction
To systematically evaluate LLMs’ reasoning capabilities across diverse urban environments, we
collect a variety of urban task scenarios as LLM observations using UAgentEnv. Each observation
encodes a snapshot of geospatial structures (e.g., road networks) and temporal dynamics (e.g., traffic
flow patterns) of the city. These serve as the contextual input for LLMs to perform reasoning over
specific urban questions. We verbalize spatial observations (e.g., road networks) as sparse adjacency
matrices with node and edge attributes [5]. Temporal observations (e.g., trajectories or time-series)
are verbalized with attribute values (e.g., visited POI or vehicle counts) across discrete time intervals
[51, 26]. Examples of such observations are illustrated in Table 2.
To collect QAs from prediction tasks, we construct observations using a sliding window of length
∆. At each step i, we extract real-world historical spatiotemporal dynamics and encode as input
observations in QA queries. For QAs constructed from decision-making tasks, we collect observations
using a heuristic agent that follows a semi-stochastic policy to interact with the environment for
varying urban contexts with diverse spatiotemporal dynamics:
(cid:40)
arg max Q(o, a), with probability 1 − ϵ
π (o) = a∈A (1)
g
random(A), with probability ϵ
where Q(o, a) is a simple utility function that scores the benefit of taking action a in state s (e.g.,
prioritizing the green signal for lanes with the longest queues). To ensure diversity of collected
scenarios, we introduce an exploration coefficient ϵ ∈ [0, 1], which controls the probability of
selecting a random action. This induces diverse decision trajectories resulting in various urban
scenarios. At each decision time step i, the observed spatiotemporal dynamics is captured and
embedded into a corresponding QA instance as agent observations.
4.1.2 Spatiotemporal Understanding QA
Spatiotemporal understanding is the first stage of problem-solving and the foundational ability to
interact with urban environments. It involves interpreting spatial relationships among urban entities
and identifying temporal patterns in events. To evaluate this ability, we design QA tasks using
contextual observations generated in Section 4.1.1. Each task challenges the LLM to identify specific
spatial relations and temporal patterns shown in the context. In total, the benchmark covers eight
well-established types of spatial and temporal patterns, drawing on definitions from prior works
[39, 41, 73, 3, 74, 47, 53]. These QAs are designed to assess whether LLMs can accurately extract
the correct spatiotemporal pattern shown in observation input.
Spatial Understanding: (1) Distance [39, 22]: Evaluating spatial proximity between entities by
ranking or comparing distances (e.g., closest POI). (2) Adjacency [41, 26]: Identifying whether two
entities (e.g., roads, regions) are directly connected or adjacent in the spatial layout. (3) Connectivity
[73, 71]: Determining whether a viable path exists between entities in a spatial network.
Temporal Understanding: (1) Duration [3, 58]: Comparing the lengths of time-based events (e.g.,
wait times) (2) Chronology [74, 58]: Understanding temporal orderings of events (e.g., sequences of
POI visits). (3) Trend [47, 27]: Identifying long-term directional patterns (e.g., increasing, decreasing,
fluctuating) in time-series data. (4) Local Extrema [53, 9]: Identifying peak or off-peak periods (e.g.,
rush hours) from time-series data fluctuations. (5) Periodicity [53]: Recognizing the length of periods
of patterns shown in time-series data, such as weekly or monthly cycles in urban dynamics.
4.1.3 Forecasting QA
Building on spatiotemporal understanding, forecasting [52, 26] allows agents to predict future urban
states, which is an essential capability not only for prediction tasks but also for modeling actionoutcome dependencies in decision-making. To evaluate forecasting as a standalone ability, we
construct QAs from the prediction tasks in UAgentEnv. Based on the historical observations o , the
i
agent is tasked to predict the future urban state at the next timestep s from a set of candidate
i+1
options. The ground truth answer is derived from the actual observed value in the real-world data.
4.1.4 Planning QA
Planning [49, 4] reflects the agent’s ability to reason over spatiotemporal observations and choose
actions that optimize long-term urban objectives. Unlike solving static problems (e.g., mathematics,
5

web search), planning in urban tasks requires agents to consider benefits over an extended horizon
within the complex and evolving environments. To assess this ability, we construct QA instances from
five urban decision-making tasks. Given the current spatiotemporal observation o , the agent is tasked
i
to select an action a ∈ A that best advances the task objective (e.g., reducing traffic congestion). The
i
ground-truth answer is computed via an feedback-driven exploratory process, in which all possible
future action sequences over a planning horizon H are observed. The action a∗ that yields the highest
i
expected cumulative feedback reward is selected:
 
H
(cid:88)
a∗ i = arg max max E  γjr i+j (a i+j ) | a i , (2)
ai∈A ai+1,...,ai+H∈A
j=0
where r (a ) is the reward at time i + j when action a is taken, and γ ∈ [0, 1] is a discount
i+j i+j i+j
factor. The expectation is estimated via multiple rollouts to account for environmental stochasticity
and ensure the reliability of the ground-truth action.
4.1.5 Reflection with Feedback QA
Unlike static problem-solving (e.g., mathematics), urban systems provide dynamic and context-rich
feedback (e.g., traffic states at next timesteps). Solving urban tasks requires not only executing
accurate actions but also reflecting on previous behaviors to adapt and improve over time [20, 38].
To evaluate this reflective reasoning capability, we construct a dataset in which previous action a
i−1
or prediction s made by the LLM is paired with environmental feedback f observed at the current
i−1 i
timestep i. The agent is then tasked to assess its prior output and determine whether the decision or
prediction was appropriate and, if not, identify the correct answer. This setup tests whether the agent
is able to diagnose errors during iterative agent-environment interactions. Such reflection is essential
for reasoning in dynamic environments, where the optimal strategy may shift due to evolving spatial
or temporal patterns. An agent that can leverage environmental feedback to iteratively refine its
reasoning demonstrates a higher level of adaptability and long-term planning competence.
4.2 End-to-End Downstream Task Evaluation
Following previous studies [25, 11, 10], we evaluate LLM performance across nine urban tasks in
UAgentEnv. Equipped with our urban agent framework, each task is uniformly evaluated using
domain-specific metrics. For example, we use Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to assess
GDP forecasting accuracy over a three-year window in socio-economic prediction. Congestion
prediction, which classifies congestion into five levels (0 to 4), is evaluated using accuracy and MAPE.
Urban planning performance is assessed based on two criteria: accessibility to service facilities
and ecological coverage. For road planning, we measure construction costs and the average travel
distance to neighboring regions. The tasks mentioned above are assessed in 5.3. Appendix G details
the evaluation metrics and results of the remaining five tasks.

contextualize LLM performance in end-to-end downstream tasks, we also compare against traditional
domain-specific baselines. Detailed configurations are provided in Appendix G.2.
5.2 Spatiotemporal Reasoning QA Evaluation
5.2.1 Spatiotemporal Understanding
Overall Results: Table 3 reports model performance on spatiotemporal understanding. Overall,
LLMs excel in interpreting urban spatiotemporal relations and patterns, with all models significantly
surpassing the random baseline and reasoning models achieving over 80% accuracy across multiple
abilities. This indicates that broad textual pretraining has embedded transferable priors for urban spatiotemporal reasoning. Additionally, their performance is notably stronger on spatial understanding,
reflecting the greater complexity and variability in comprehending temporal dynamics than static

spatial structures. Despite these advantages, LLMs struggle with structured data involving spatial
connectivity (e.g., road networks), event chronology (e.g., POI trajectories), and long-term trends or
periodicity in time-series data (e.g., traffic flow shifts), which often falls below 70% accuracy. These
challenges likely stem from pretraining predominantly on unstructured text, which limits the models’
ability to reason over structured inputs. Moreover, DeepSeek-R1-7B shows a marked drop due to
repetition issues [23]. Further analysis is provided in Appendix G.4.2.
Non-Reasoning LLMs vs. Reasoning LLMs: Reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, and
GLM-Z1 generally outperform their base models of similar sizes with gains of 7–20%, highlighting
the benefits of reasoning-focused post-training. However, their advantage is not consistent. Firstly,
GPT-4o often matches or exceeds models like GLM-Z1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B, suggesting that general post-training on logical and mathematical problems does not always benefit
urban spatiotemporal reasoning and may introduce unnecessary complexity. Notably, as stated in
Section 1, DeepSeek-R1 falls short in temporal trend understanding, exposing its limitations in
urban dynamic analysis. In contrast, Llama3.3-70B excels in this ability among non-reasoning
models. Interestingly, this strength has been successfully transferred to DeepSeek-R1-70B, which
is post-trained on Llama3.3 and excels in this task. This motivates us to further explore targeted
enhancement methods, such as domain-adaptive training, to improve these abilities.
5.2.2 Forecasting and Planning
Interplay between Forecasting and Planning: Table 4 summarizes model performance on forecasting and planning. The results show that most LLMs exhibit promising forecasting capabilities,
with leading models achieving accuracy above 70%. In contrast, their performance on planning is
substantially lower, revealing that current LLMs struggle to make accurate decisions aligned with
long-term objectives. This disparity highlights the increased complexity of planning and reinforces
our claim in Section 4.1.3 that planning is a higher-order ability, dependent on and extending beyond
forecasting. However, in tasks involving long-term temporal trend analysis (e.g., congestion and
traffic-OD prediction), non-reasoning base models outperform reasoning variants, such as Qwen-2.5
vs. QwQ, and Llama3.3 vs. DeepSeek-R1. This further suggests that the general enhancement of
reasoning abilities does not always benefit unique challenges in urban scenarios.
Interplay among Spatiotemporal Understanding, Forecasting, and Planning: Models that excel
in spatiotemporal understanding generally perform better in forecasting and planning. For instance,
we observed similar results on Llama3.3 and DeepSeek-R1 as Section 5.2.1, where Llama3.3 not
only excels on temporal trend understanding but also in congestion and traffic-OD prediction. To
validate this connection, we post-train Qwen2.5-7B on synthetic spatiotemporal reasoning datasets
(the training details are shown in Appendix F. As illustrated in Figure 4, the fine-tuned model
(Qwen2.5-7B-ST) significantly outperforms its base version, confirming the benefit of improved
spatiotemporal understanding to downstream reasoning processes. Future research could focus
on: (1) improving LLMs’ reasoning ability over complex structured spatiotemporal data, and (2)
integrating tools and code-based modeling to support more robust spatiotemporal pattern extraction.
Both avenues could further advance LLM effectiveness in these two downstream reasoning abilities.

5.2.3 Reflection with Feedback
Limitations in Reflection Ability: Table 4 shows that most LLMs achieve less than 50% accuracy
on reflection tasks, highlighting a key limitation: current models struggle to incorporate feedback and
adapt their reasoning over time. Reflection requires diagnosing errors and generalizing experience to
subsequent reasoning and actions, which is a critical ability for long-term adaptation and strategy
adjustment in dynamic urban settings. We further analyze how reflection influences downstream task
performance and other reasoning processes in Section 5.3.
5.3 Downstream Task Evaluation
Overall Results: Table 5 presents the performance of LLMs on four representative downstream
urban tasks. Generally, LLMs outperform traditional domain-specific baselines across prediction and
decision-making tasks. Notably, we observe relative performance improvements of up to 337.31%
in forecasting accuracy and 53.48% in decision outcomes. This reinforces the promise of LLMs as
flexible and robust agents for various spatiotemporal tasks in urban scenarios. In particular, models
such as Qwen2.5-32B and LLaMA3.3 achieve superior performance compared to their reasoningaugmented variants (e.g., QwQ and DeepSeek-R1) on tasks like congestion prediction. This aligns
with our earlier findings in Section 5.2.2, where process-based evaluations revealed their reasoning
bottlenecks in forecasting capabilities.
The Impact of Reflection: To assess the role of reflection, we conducted ablation studies comparing
agent performance with and without reflective reasoning. As shown in Figure 5, its removal led to
clear performance drops on DeepSeek-R1, the model with the best reflection ability, highlighting
its importance in enhancing adaptability in dynamic urban environments. However, this benefit is
less consistent in models with moderate reflection capabilities (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B), where reflective
outputs do not reliably enhance subsequent forecasting or planning. Conversely, in models with
limited reflection ability (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B), disabling reflection can even improve performance,
suggesting that low-quality reflective content may introduce noise and degrade downstream reasoning.
6 Related Work
Urban Agent: Urban agents have evolved from rule-based systems to RL agents and now LLM-based
models. Early systems like SCOOT [17] and SCATS [30] used fixed heuristics and sensor data for
traffic control. RL approaches, such as CoLight [54], introduced data-driven adaptive learning using
graph attention networks. Recently, LLM-based agents, like LLMLight [21], UrbanGPT[26], and

Spatiotemporal Reasoning: Spatial reasoning in LLMs has been assessed by understanding spatial
relations [31, 32]. Later works introduced multi-hop reasoning tasks [41] and urban-scale challenges
[65, 67]. Notably, CityEQA [69] extends spatial reasoning to embodied agents navigating city
spaces. Temporal reasoning focuses on understanding event sequences and durations. Studies such
as [74, 9, 42, 7] examined commonsense and structured temporal logic. Spatiotemporal reasoning
integrates both spatial and temporal dynamics. Recent work [33, 59, 16] analyzed how LLMs
interpret spatiotemporal patterns. In urban contexts, benchmarks like STBench [25] and CityBench
[11] evaluate the reasoning abilities on trajectories and interactions between spatial entities over time.
LLM Complex Reasoning: LLM reasoning has seen rapid advances through chain-of-thought
techniques [55], which improves multi-step problem solving by encouraging intermediate reasoning.
First, instruction tuning approaches, such as AgentTuning [64], boost reasoning quality. Recently,
post-training strategies adopted by models like OpenAI-o1 [19], DeepSeek-R1 [15], and QwQ [44]
incorporate RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [40] and Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to refine reasoning through reward-guided optimization.
7 Conclusion and Limitations
Conclusion: We present USTBench, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating the spatiotemporal reasoning abilities of LLMs as urban agents. Built on the interactive environment UAgentEnv,
USTBench supports both fine-grained diagnostics to specific reasoning abilities and end-to-end
task evaluations for standardized performance assessment. Our evaluation of leading LLMs shows
that while current models excel in spatiotemporal understanding and forecasting, they struggle with
higher-order reasoning tasks, particularly long-term action planning and adaptive reflection. Notably, reasoning models trained on general logic and mathematics do not consistently outperform
non-reasoning models in urban-specific tasks, highlighting the need for domain-specific approaches.
Limitations: USTBench primarily focuses on evaluation, while systematic methods for enhancing
spatiotemporal reasoning are still underexplored. Additionally, our evaluations are conducted mainly
in simulated environments. Although simulations are controllable and scalable, real-world validation
and human assessment are essential for urban applications. Future work will explore targeted training
approaches and integrate real-world experiments with human evaluations to address these gaps.

A Limitations
Exploration on Enhancement Methods: USTBench is designed primarily as a comprehensive
benchmark to rigorously evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning abilities of LLMs as urban agents.
However, a systematic method for improving these reasoning capabilities remains underexplored.
Current LLMs often struggle with complex, long-term planning and adaptive reflection, while
USTBench only proposed a simple method with post-training on spatiotemporal understanding.
Developing targeted learning approaches, such as domain-specific fine-tuning, reinforcement learning
with feedback, or multi-modal integration, will be crucial next steps to enhance LLM performance on
spatiotemporal urban reasoning tasks.
Real-world Environment Benchmarking: While USTBench leverages the UAgentEnv to provide
controlled, scalable, and diverse urban scenarios for evaluation, this approach inherently limits
exposure to real-world complexity and noise. Simulations may not fully capture unexpected events
and rare occurrences reflecting urban dynamics. Moreover, human judgment and expert assessment
are critical in real urban planning and management. Future work should incorporate real-world field
tests and integrate human feedback to validate and improve LLM performance, ensuring practical
applicability and robustness in live urban environments.
B Confidence Interval of Evaluation
In Table 6, we report the confidence intervals for representative models based on three experimental
runs with different random seeds.

C Runtime Estimation
The evaluation runtime of an LLM varies depending on the hardware or API, the specific model,
and the inference platform employed. In this study, we estimate runtimes for open-source LLMs
using vLLM, and for GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini through the OpenAI API. Except for DeepSeek-R1,
we evaluate with the Alibaba Bailian API. The estimated time of our process-based spatiotemporal
reasoning evaluation is shown in Table 7.

DeepSeek-R1 Alibaba Bailian API - 97.33 s/batch 32 60.05 h
o4-mini OpenAI API - 5.61 s/batch 16 7.87 h
D Ethics and Societal Impact
USTBench aims to systematically evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs in
urban applications such as traffic control, mobility prediction, and urban planning. To ensure privacy,
our benchmark exclusively uses publicly available datasets and ensures that no personally identifiable
information is included. While these evaluations advance the understanding of LLM capabilities, they
also underscore the responsibility to ensure that such models are used ethically. LLM-driven urban
agents could influence public infrastructure, mobility patterns, and access to services. Therefore,
deploying these models without proper oversight or fail-safes could lead to unintended negative
outcomes, especially for vulnerable populations in urban settings.

E Details of Environments
E.1 Urban Task Suite and Environment Platform
Next POI Prediction: Predicts movement patterns within urban areas, helping to understand how
individuals travel between points of interest (POIs). Following the settings proposed by [51], we use
FourSquare datasets [61] for evaluation.
Socio-Economic Prediction: Estimates future socio-economic indicators (i.e., GDP) based on
historical observations and population density. We collect time-series data on GDP and population
development from 2000 to 2019 [50, 57] in Guangzhou, China, for future value prediction.
Congestion Prediction: Anticipates areas where traffic flow will become heavy. We follow the
settings of [6] and evaluate LLMs using traffic data from Beijing, China.
Traffic-OD Prediction: Estimates vehicle flow between origin and destination regions. We follow
the short-term prediction settings of [62] and use taxi traffic flow datasets from New York, USA.
Traffic Signal Control: Optimizes traffic signal timing to improve traffic flow. Following the settings
of [21, 63], we evaluate performance using traffic flow and road network datasets from Hangzhou,
China [66]. The simulation environment is built based on CityFlow [43].
POI Placement: Determines optimal locations for urban services, such as shops and restaurants,
ensuring strategic placement to serve the population and reduce congestion. For evaluation, we follow
the settings of [48] and collect a charging station placement dataset in Guangzhou, China.
Road Planning: Involves designing and optimizing road networks to enhance transportation efficiency. This task requires analyzing road connectivity and infrastructure needs. We follow the settings
and environment of [73] and use road network data from Cape Town, South Africa, for evaluation.
Route Planning: Determines optimal paths for vehicles, considering traffic conditions, distance, and
travel time. Following the settings of [24], we use New York’s road network and simulate traffic
using the SUMO traffic simulator [29].
Urban Planning: Involves designing urban spaces for sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.
Following [71], we use urban geospatial data from Beijing, China, and build interaction environments.
E.2 Environment Configuration
For process-based spatiotemporal reasoning evaluation, we generate QA instances using UAgentEnv.
Environmental observations in decision-making tasks are collected using a semi-stochastic policy
with an exploration coefficient ϵ = 0.1 to ensure diversity. Ground-truth answers for planning QA
are derived through a feedback-driven exploratory process, with a planning horizon H = 5 and a
discount factor γ = 0.9. During downstream task evaluation, we configure historical observation and
prediction windows based on task characteristics. For socio-economic prediction, we use a 6-year
observation window and a 3-year prediction window. For traffic-related tasks—congestion prediction
and traffic OD prediction, we adopt a 12-step observation window and a 12-step prediction window.
In the next POI prediction task, the agent receives a 30-day activity history and previous visits on the
same day and predicts the next visited POI. For route planning, we synthesize urban mobility patterns
using the gravity model [24], calibrated on real-world population distributions in New York City. The
configurations for decision-making environments follow established benchmarks and experimental
protocols from prior work [54, 48, 24, 73, 71].
E.3 Agent Prompt
Our agent framework incorporates three prompt templates designed for task-solving, reflection,
and memory storage. In the task-solving prompt, the agent is instructed to perform a multi-stage
reasoning process: 1) it first interprets the spatiotemporal context of the environment; 2) then either
forecasts future urban states or predicts the outcomes of candidate actions; 3) finally, the agent outputs
anticipated urban states for prediction tasks or selects an optimal action for decision-making tasks.
After execution and receiving environmental feedback, the agent is instructed by the reflection prompt
to evaluate the effectiveness of its prior decision and summarizes the outcome as an experience to
inform future reasoning. These experiences are subsequently aggregated and stored in memory to
16

support continual adaptation with the summary prompt. The detailed prompt templates used in each
stage are provided in Table 20-22.
F LLM Post-Training
F.1 Instruction Construction
We post-train Qwen2.5-7B using a synthetic instruction tuning dataset, designed to enhance the
model’s capability to interpret spatiotemporal dynamics in urban scenarios. To generate instructions,
we first prompt GPT-4o to produce diverse urban scenarios involving various entities and events.
Each scenario is designed to elicit a specific spatiotemporal understanding ability, prompting the
model to analyze spatial relationships or temporal patterns:
Distance: We randomly assign distances between roads, routes, or urban entities. The model is asked
to identify the longest or shortest elements or to compare distances between pairs of entities.
Adjacency & Connectivity: We Erdo˝s–R’enyi (ER) model [8] to generate random spatial graphs
representing urban layouts. The model is then asked to determine adjacency (i.e., nearby neighbors)
or connectivity (i.e., path existence between entities).
Duration: We simulate urban events (e.g., travel, wait times) with randomly assigned durations. The
model is tasked with identifying the longest or shortest event or comparing durations between events.
Chronology: We use POI check-in data from Tokyo [61] (distinct from the dataset used in USTBench).
The model is tasked to identify the correct temporal sequence of check-in events.
Trend, Local Extrema, and Periodicity: We leverage real-world urban time-series datasets, including PEMS04 (traffic flow), Solar (solar power output), and Electricity (power usage). The model is
instructed to identify global trends (e.g., increasing/decreasing), local extrema (e.g., peak hours), and
periodicity (e.g., daily/weekly cycles).
F.2 Supervised Distillation Fine-Tuning
Leveraging the constructed instructions described above, we collect responses from DeepSeek-R1
using rejection sampling to ensure high-quality outputs. Representative examples of the instruction
tuning data are provided in Table 23-30. For supervised fine-tuning, we adopt Llama-Factory [70]
with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for training. The learning rate is set to 1 × 10−4.
G Detailed Evaluations
G.1 Downstream Task Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate LLMs’ downstream task performance across nine urban tasks using task-specific metrics.
Socio-economic prediction: We apply Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to assess GDP
forecasting accuracy over a three-year window. Congestion prediction: This task is framed as a
five-level classification task (levels 0–4), and is evaluated using MAPE and accuracy. Traffic-OD
prediction: We adopt Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(SMAPE) to evaluate forecasting accuracy for vehicle arrivals and departures. Next POI prediction:
We use Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to measure the recall quality of predictions.
Urban planning: This task is assessed through accessibility to service facilities and ecological
coverage. Road planning: The performance is measured by construction costs and the average travel
distance to neighboring regions. POI placement: The task is evaluated by the average travel and
waiting time for urban services. Traffic signal control: The performance is measured using average
travel time (ATT) and waiting time (AWT) in the road network. Route planning: The task is evaluated
using average travel time and network throughput.
G.2 Baseline Configuration
LLM Configuration: In this study, we mainly evaluate open-source LLMs using the vLLM inference
framework. For proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, we utilize the OpenAI API,
while DeepSeek-R1 is evaluated via the Alibaba Bailian API. All evaluations are conducted with
a fixed decoding temperature of 0.1 to ensure reproducibility. Inference of open-sourced LLMs is
performed on a server equipped with two NVIDIA A800-80GB GPUs.
17

Domain-specific Method Configuration: To provide a comprehensive performance comparison,
we also benchmark LLMs against traditional methods widely used in each domain: For time-series
forecasting tasks (urban development prediction and congestion detection), we use ARIMA [2] as the
baseline model. For urban planning, we employ a geometric set coverage algorithm (GSCA) [56],
which solves a geometric set-coverage-like problem by maximizing the spatial coverage of designated
land-use types. For road planning, we apply a genetic algorithm [12], where a linear layer represents
road features, and roads are incrementally constructed based on learned sampling probabilities.
G.3 Downstream Task Performance
The downstream task performance of representative LLMs is shown in Table 8. Notably, reasoning
LLMs do not consistently outperform their non-reasoning base models in real-world urban scenarios.
This indicates that advances in general mathematical and logical reasoning do not necessarily benefit
urban tasks. The finding underscores the importance of developing domain-specific approaches
tailored to the unique challenges of urban spatiotemporal reasoning.
Table 8: Performance on downstream urban tasks. Lower values (↓) for MAPE, SMAPE, MAE,
Cost, Distance, ATT, and AWT indicate better performance. Higher values (↑) for Accuracy, Service,
Ecology, Precision, MRR, and Throughput indicate better outcomes.

by GPT-4o. In contrast, while DeepSeek-R1 delivers strong performance, its reasoning processes are often verbose and time-consuming, making
it less suitable for real-time deployment scenarios (e.g., traffic management). These findings highlight research opportunities to develop lightweight and efficient paradigms for urban spatiotemporal
reasoning, drawing inspiration from designs like o4-mini and GPT-4o.
G.4.2 Repetition Issues
We observe severe repetition issues on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen2.5-7B, where it underperforms
its base model, Qwen2.5-7B, on several tasks. Upon analyzing its reasoning traces, we find that
the model tends to repeat certain thought patterns, called "aha moments" [15], without progressing
toward a solution. This repetitive behavior resembles ineffective in-context learning loops, and
appears more pronounced in specialized domains like urban tasks. While such issues have been
18

partially mitigated in mathematical and logical reasoning, they remain a persistent challenge in other
specialized domains. Figure 18 provides examples of failed reasoning processes.

ü Qwen2.5-32B: The regions are ranked based on their shortest distance from the target region 442, with the closest regions having the
strongest spatial correlation. The ranking from strongest to weakest correlation is: 467, 443, 418, 492, 468, 417. Option B.
ü DeepSeek-R1: The spatial correlation is determined by the shortest distance from the target region (442) to each nearby region. Based
on the adjacency data, the distances are calculated as follows: Region 443 (6.09km), Region 492 (9.02km via 467), Region 468
(10.59km via 443), and Region 417 (13.67km via 418 or 443). Ranking from strongest to weakest correlation (shortest to longest
distance) gives the order: 443 > 492 > 468 > 417, which corresponds to option B.
ü o4-mini: By computing shortest-path distances in the adjacency graph—442→443 (6.09 km), 442→467→492 (9.02 km), 442→443→468
(10.59 km), and 442→443→417 (13.67 km)—we rank regions by increasing distance (strongest to weakest spatial correlation) as 443 >
492 > 468 > 417. Option B.

Response
<think>
Okay, let’s see. The question is asking how neighborhood 9 compares to neighborhood 3 in terms
of their distance to the new park, and which one is closer. The options are A for neighborhood 9
and B for neighborhood 3.
34

First, I need to look up the distances for both neighborhoods. From the data provided:
- Neighborhood 3 has a distance of 16.19 km.
- Neighborhood 9 has a distance of 7.08 km.
So, comparing these two numbers, 7.08 km is definitely less than 16.19 km. That means neighborhood 9 is closer to the park than neighborhood 3. Therefore, the answer should be A.
Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn’t mix up the numbers. Neighborhood 3 is over
16 km away, which is quite far, while neighborhood 9 is just over 7 km. Yep, that’s correct. The
smaller the distance number, the closer they are. So neighborhood 9 is closer. The answer is A.

Response
<think>
Okay, let’s see. The task is to find which of school 1 or crosswalk 3 has a stronger spatial
correlation with school 5. The data given is the connectivity between entities, which includes
schools and crosswalks.
First, the definition says that the connectivity is an undirected edge between two entities with a
distance. So each tuple represents how those two entities are connected and the distance. I need to
look at the data provided and see how school 5 is connected to these entities.
Looking at the data entries: - (school 1, crosswalk 3, 1623m) - (school 1, school 5, 98m) - (school
1, school 4, 1428m) - (crosswalk 2, school 4, 1995m)
School 5 is only mentioned once here, in the second tuple. So school 5 is directly connected
to school 1 with a very short distance of 98 meters. That’s really close. Now, crosswalk 3 is
connected to school 1 but in the same tuple as school 1: (school 1, crosswalk 3, 1623m). So the
distance here is 1623 meters, which is much farther.
But how does crosswalk 3 relate to school 5? Since crosswalk 3 is connected to school 1, and
school 1 is connected to school 5. So there’s an indirect path from crosswalk 3 to school 5 through
35

school 1. The total distance would be 1623m + 98m = 1721m. Or is it considered as the minimal
path? Either way, compared to school 1’s direct 98m to school 5, crosswalk 3 is much farther
away.
Spatial correlation here likely depends on proximity. The closer two entities are, the stronger their
spatial correlation. So since school 1 is extremely close to school 5 (98m), while crosswalk 3 is
over 1.6 km away from school 1 and hence over 1.7 km from school 5, school 1 would have a
stronger spatial correlation with school 5.
Crosswalk 3 is not directly connected to school 5 in the data. The only connection is through school
1. But even then, the total distance is way larger. The data doesn’t have any other connections
from crosswalk 3 to other entities except school 1. Therefore, school 1 is directly adjacent and
very close, making it the stronger candidate.
Wait, but the problem is about which (school 1 or crosswalk 3) is more correlated spatially with
school 5. Since school 1 is directly connected with school 5 at 98m, that’s a direct and short
link. Crosswalk 3 is connected to school 1 (1623m away) which is connected to school 5 (98m).
But crosswalk 3 itself isn’t directly linked to school 5. So spatial correlation would depend on
distance between entities. School 1 is right next to school 5, making their spatial correlation strong.
Crosswalk 3 is much further away. So the answer should be school 1.
</think>
{
"answer": "school 1",
"summary": "School 1 has a stronger spatial correlation with school
5 because it is directly connected to school 5 via a very short edge
(98 m). Crosswalk 3 is connected to school 1 but is much farther away
(1623 m) and has no direct connection to school 5. Proximity strongly
influences spatial correlation, and school 1’s adjacency to school 5
outweighs crosswalk 3’s indirect, distant relationship."

Okay, let me try to figure out if fire station 2 is reachable from densely populated area 5. I need to
see if there’s a path connecting them through the given edges. Let’s look at the data carefully.
First, let’s list out all the connections provided. Each tuple is an undirected edge, so movement
can go both ways. The nodes include densely populated areas (like area1, area7, etc.) and fire
stations (like fire station 2 and 3).
Starting from densely populated area5. Let’s see what connections it has. Looking through the list,
I spot (fire station3, densely populated area5, 8km). Oh, right, area5 is connected to fire station3
with a distance. Additionally, there’s (fire station2, densely populated area5, 9km). Wait, is that
a direct connection between fire station2 and area5? Let me check again. Yes, the tuple (fire
station2, densely populated area5, 9km) exists. So if area5 is directly connected to fire station2,
then the answer should be yes. But wait, let me confirm if that connection is indeed there.
Looking back at the data provided:
The tuples are as follows:
- (fire station2, densely populated area5, 9km) is one of them. So that means area5 is directly
connected to fire station2 with 9km. Therefore, there’s a direct path. No need to go through other
nodes. Thus, area5 can reach fire station2 directly. So the answer should be Yes.

<think>
Alright, let’s tackle this problem step by step. I need to compare the duration of two specific power
outages: number 5 and number 0. The data provided gives the durations in hours, so first I’ll list
those out.
Looking at the data schema, each entry is labeled as "power outage duration X" with a corresponding duration value. Specifically:
- Power outage duration 0 has a duration of 0.1 hours. - Power outage duration 5 has a duration of
1.18 hours. The question asks which of these two is longer. So, I just need to compare the two
numbers: 1.18h vs. 0.1h.
1.18 hours is clearly larger than 0.1 hours. Therefore, power outage duration 5 is longer than
duration 0. I can confirm by converting to minutes if necessary. 0.1 hours is 6 minutes, while 1.18
hours is about 70.8 minutes. Yep, that’s much longer.
No other data points affect this particular comparison since we are only looking at these two
instances. So the answer is straightforward.

Response
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which event happens most recently based on the data provided. Let’s
look through all the days and their trajectory entries. The key here is to find the latest time on the
latest date.
First, I should check each day’s trajectory to see the time and day of the week. All days are
numbered from Day 1 to Day 30. Since each day is likely consecutive, Day 30 would be the last
one in the sequence. Let me confirm with the data given.
Looking at Day 30:
- The trajectory is [(Train Station 274, Sunday, 05:35 PM), (Miscellaneous Shop 13944, Sunday,
06:02 PM)]
So on Sunday at 06:02 PM, the user visited Miscellaneous Shop 13944.
But wait, are there later days? No, the days go up to Day 30, so that’s the latest day in the dataset.
Now, looking at the entries on Day 30, the events are at 5:35 PM and 6:02 PM on Sunday.
Are there any other entries in later days with a later time? Let me scan through the other days just
to make sure. Let’s check Day 29, 28, etc. to see if any times are later in the same day.
Day 29 has a trajectory entry on Saturday at 04:58 AM. That’s way earlier. Day 28: Friday, entries
up to 07:03 PM. But Saturday would come before Sunday (the next day), so Day 30 is definitely
after Day 28 and 29.
Double-check the times on Day 30: the latest time there is 6:02 PM (18:02) on Sunday. Miscellaneous Shop 13944 is the last entry here.
Are there any events on Day 30 that are later than 6:02 PM? The trajectory has two entries: 5:35
PM and 6:02 PM. The latest is 06:02 PM. That’s the most recent time in the data.
But wait, maybe another day with a more recent time? For example, maybe a day that’s also
Sunday but with a later time. Let me check all other Sundays.
Looking through the data:
Day 1 is Sunday (06:00 PM and 07:14 PM). Day 6 is Sunday (04:43 PM). Day 11: Sunday (07:20
PM). Day 16: Sunday (12:29 AM and 12:38 AM). Day 30: Sunday (05:35 PM, 06:02 PM).
The latest Sunday in the dataset is Day 30, and the times there are 5:35 PM and 6:02 PM. But
earlier, for example, Day 11 has an event at 7:20 PM. But that Day 11 is earlier (the 11th day),
while Day 30 is the 30th day, so even though the time is earlier on a Sunday, the actual date (Day
30) is later. So the Day 30’s 6:02 PM is more recent than any entries in previous Sundays, because
Day 30 is a later day.
Therefore, the most recent event is Miscellaneous Shop 13944 at 06:02 PM on Sunday. So the
answer would be "Miscellaneous Shop".
Wait, in the data entry for Day 30, each event in the trajectory is listed with time. Both entries are
on Sunday. The Miscellaneous Shop is the later time. So yes, that’s the most recent event in the
entire dataset.

Response
<think>
Okay, let’s tackle this problem step by step. The task is to analyze the time series data of solar
energy generation power in MW every 10 minutes from 12:00 to 13:50. The question is asking
about the trend—whether it’s increasing, decreasing, or if there’s no clear trend. If the overall
trend isn’t clear, we need to split the data into two halves and analyze each separately. First, I’ll
look at the entire dataset. The timestamps start at 12:00 and go up to 13:50, making 12 data points,
each 10 minutes apart. Let’s list the values in order: 30.5, 30.25, 29.8, 29.7, 29.45, 28.2, 27.05,
26.65, 26.4, 25.9, 25.35, 24.6 MW. Visually examining these values, each subsequent reading is
lower than the previous one. Let’s check: From 30.5 to 30.25 (slight decrease), then 29.8, 29.7,
29.45... all the way down to 24.6. Each step shows a reduction. There’s a consistent downward
trend without any increases. So the overall trend might be a decrease.
But wait, the instruction says to first check the entire 12-step series. Then, if no clear trend, split
into two halves. Let me confirm each value again. Starting with 30.5 at 12:00, every next step is
lower. For example: Step 1: 30.5 to 30.25 (down) Step 2: 30.5 →30.25 →29.8 →29.7 →29.45
→28.2 (each subsequent is lower). Then from 28.2 to 27.05, down to 24.6. So, all 12 points are
steadily decreasing. So the overall trend for the entire period is a decrease.
Wait, no—I might need to check if the rate is consistent. For example, is the decrease steady
across all data points? Let’s list the values again:
40

1. 30.5 2. 30.25 (-0.25) 3. 29.8 (-0.45) 4. 29.7 (-0.1) 5. 29.45 (-0.25) 6. 28.2 (-1.25) 7. 27.05
(-1.15) 8. 26.65 (-0.4) 9. 26.4 (-0.25) 10. 25.9 (-0.5) 11. 25.35 (-0.55) 12. 24.6 (-0.75) So the rate
of decrease varies. For instance, steps 6 and 7 have larger drops (like -1.25 and -1.15). But even
then, every step is lower than the preceding one. So regardless of how much it’s decreasing, the
trend is consistently downward.
Wait, but the first half (first six steps) shows a downward trend, and the second half (last six steps)
also shows a downward trend. So both halves individually have a decreasing trend. That means
the entire time series has a consistent decreasing trend. Therefore, the overall answer should be a
decrease.
But wait—the problem says if the entire trend is unclear, split into two. But in this case, all points
are decreasing. So the trend is clearly a decrease. Hence, the answer should be a single decreasing
trend for the entire period. Therefore, the summary would state that the solar generation power
shows a consistent decrease across all 12 steps with no periods of increase, leading to an overall
downward trend.

subsequent measurement being lower than the previous one. The rate of

Response
<think>
Okay, let’s see. The task is to identify a local maxima peak hour in the traffic flow data provided.
So first, I need to understand what a local maximum is in this context. A local maximum in a time
series is a point where the value is higher than its immediate neighbors. That means, looking for
41

times when the traffic flow increased to a peak and then started decreasing. Looking at the data
provided, which spans from February 3rd to February 5th, each hour has a traffic value. So I need
to go through each hour and check if the current hour’s value is higher than the previous and next
hour’s values. Those would be the local maxima.
Let me list out the values with their times. Starting with February 3rd:
00:00: 36.416..., 01:00: 19.833... → decrease from previous., 02:00: 14.083..., 03:00:19.333...,
04:00:36.916..., 05:00:67.083..., 06:00:106.166..., 07:00:161.75..., 08:00:234.166...,
09:00:256.166..., 10:00:279.83..., 11:00:297.5..., 12:00:309.416..., 13:00:301.25 → This
is lower than 12:00’s 309.41, so 12:00 is a peak? Let’s check. The 12:00 value (309.416) is
higher than 11:00 (297.5) and then decreases at 13:00. Yes, so that’s a local max. So 2018-02-03
12:00:00 could be a peak.
Then 14:00:285.33, 15:00:276.16, 16:00:306.5 → comparing to 15:00 and 17:00. So 16:00’s
306.5 vs previous 276.16 and next hour (17:00) 292.25. So 16:00 on the 3rd is higher than before
and after, another local maximum.
Then 17:00:292.25... then it goes down. Then 18th hour: decreases to 255.1, so the peak at 16:00.
Looking at Feb 4th. Let me look through their hours. The data from Feb 4th starts at 00:00 again.
Let’s check peaks there.
For example, at 08:00 Feb 4th: 200.58..., 09:00:239.66, 10:00:239.66, 11:00:272.58, 12:00:280.83,
13:00:283.91, 14:00:300.66. Wait, at 13:00, it’s 283.91, then 14:00’s 300.66. Is that higher than
15:00? Next hour (15:00 Feb4) is 256.25. So 14:00 is higher than both 13:00 and 15:00; so 14:00
on Feb4 is a local peak.
Then at 19:00 Feb4, the value is 187.91, and 20:00 is 192.33 → not a peak. Let me check other
times.
On Feb 5th, the data shows: 05:00:288.41, 06:00:390.08..., 07:00:384.83, 08:00:366.16... So here,
06:00 is higher than 05:00 and 07:00. So that’s a peak at 06:00 on Feb5th. Then later, at 17:00
Feb5: 392.16, which is higher than 16:00 (312.25) and 18:00 (305.0). So 17:00 on Feb5 is another
local maximum. That’s a notable peak.
So possible candidates for local maxima are:
- 2018-02-03 12:00:00 (309.41)
- 2018-02-03 16:00:00 (306.5)
- 2018-02-04 14:00:00 (300.66)
- 2018-02-05 06:00:00 (390.08)
- 2018-02-05 17:00:00 (392.16)
Now, the question asks to identify one of these local maxima. The user just needs one, probably the
highest or the most prominent. Let’s check the values. The largest numbers I see are from February
5th. The 05:00 on Feb5 is 288, then 06:00 jumps to 390—almost 400, which is a significant spike.
Then at 17:00 on Feb5, it goes up to 392.16. Comparing those two, 392.16 is higher than 390.08.
Both are peaks. Let me confirm:
05:00 Feb5:288.41 06:00:390.08 (peaks here, since the next hour at 07:00 is 384.83, which is
lower) Then at 08:00:366.16 So at 06:00, higher than before and after — peak.
Then 17:00 on Feb5 is 392.16, which follows 16:00 (312.25) and precedes 18:00 (305.0). So that’s
another peak. So 17:00 is higher than 06:00. Which one should I choose?
The task is to find "one" of them. So selecting either would be correct. However, the highest local
maximum would be 17:00 on Feb5 (392.16). Alternatively, the spike in 06:00 on Feb5 may be
because it’s part of the early morning rush, but the user just wants one example. Maybe the highest
one.
But let’s verify if there are higher points anywhere else.
Looking at Feb3: max is 309 at 12pm. Feb4’s max at 14:00 is 300.6. So Feb5 peaks at 392 and
390.
Yes. So I need to report one. For instance, 2018-02-05 17:00:00 with 392.16 as the local maximum,
because that’s higher than the surrounding hours. Alternatively, the 06:00 hour on Feb5 is also a
local maximum. But since the task allows any one, it’s sufficient to pick either.
But the highest is 17:00 on the 5th. Alternatively, perhaps there is a typo, let me check the data
again.
Looking at February 5th’s 05:00: 288.41. 06:00: 390.08. 07:00: 384.83. So 06:00 is higher than
both, so that’s a local maximum. Then again, at 17:00, 392.16 is higher than 16:00’s 312 and
18:00’s 305. So both those times are peaks.
Of these, 392 at 17:00 is higher than the 390 at 6:00. So 17:00 is a higher peak.
42

So the correct answer would likely be either of these. So to answer the user’s question, I can
choose the 17:00 on Feb5 as one example.

Task Description
You are tasked to analyze the time series data of electricity consumption (in Wh).
Data Schema
- time-series: Each tuple (value, time) represents a data reading in Wh recorded at the specified
time.
Data
The time-series of electricity consumption (in Wh) in every 1 hour is provided below:
[(112.0Wh, 2018-03-11 02:00:00), (114.0Wh, 2018-03-11 03:00:00),

2018-03-11 08:00:00)...]
Question
How long is the period of electricity consumption (in Wh)?
Note
Let’s work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure that we have the right answer. Finally,
summarize your analysis with JSON format, like:
“‘JSON {
"summary": "YOUR_SUMMARY"
}
“‘
<think>
Okay, so the task here is to determine the period of the electricity consumption based on the given
time series data. Hmm, the term "period" in time series usually refers to the length of a repeating
cycle or pattern. Let me think.
Looking at the data, the timestamps start on 2018-03-11 at 02:00:00 and go through each hour
until 2018-03-14 at 01:00:00. Let me first check the timestamps to see over how many days this
data spans.
Start date: March 11th at 2 AM. The data includes March 11, 12, 13, and part of the 14th (ending
at 1 AM on the 14th). So that’s roughly three days. Wait, from March 11th 02:00 to March 14th
01:00 is 24h * 3 days minus one hour. So about 71 hours? Let’s count. From the first entry to
the last entry: 11th 02:00 to 14th 01:00. The total number of data points is for each hour, and the
entries seem consecutive with no gaps. Let me count the data points to check.
Looking at the data provided, each entry increments by one hour. Let’s see: first entry at 02:00,
next at 03:00, up to the last at 01:00 on the 14th. The list starts with (11th 02:00) and ends with
(14th 01:00). Since each entry is hourly, the total hours between first and last would be from 02:00
on 3/11 to 01:00 on 3/14. How many hours is that?
From 3/11 02:00 to 3/14 02:00 would be exactly 3 days (72 hours). But since the last entry is
01:00 on 3/14, it’s 72 -1 =71 hours. But each entry corresponds to an hour, so number of data
points would be 71+1? Wait, no. Let me see. The first entry is at 02:00, next 03:00, etc. So from
02:00 to 24:00 on 3/11 is 22 entries (hours 2-23 inclusive, which is 22 hours?). Wait, no. Wait,
43

2 AM to 11 PM is 22 hours (since 24-2=22, but with each hour included. Wait, 02:00, 03:00,...23:00
for 3/11. Then next day starts at 00:00. Hmm, the data goes through 3/11, including the next day’s
entries. Let me recount the days covered. The data starts on 11th, March at 02:00 and ends on
March 14th at 01:00. So 11th, 12th, 13th, and part of 14th.
But the main point here isn’t the span of the data but looking for the periodicity in the data. For
electricity consumption, typically there’s a daily pattern—higher during the day, lower at night.
Let’s check the values to see if they exhibit a daily cycle.
Looking at the data: each day starts with lower values in the early morning, increasing during the
day. For example, March 11th, around 10:00 AM (10:00:00), there’s a spike to 543Wh, which
seems like a huge jump compared to the previous hours. Then on March 12th, at 10:00, it’s 526
Wh, also a spike. Same on March 13th: at 10:00, 552 Wh. So every day at around 10 AM, there’s
a big increase. After that, consumption remains high during the day and starts to drop in the
evening. Then at 20:00 (8 PM) each day, it drops to around 359Wh (March 11), 361 (March 12),
357 (March 13), then drops further to around 160-168Wh in the late evening. Then this pattern
repeats each day.
So that’s a clear daily period, where each day the consumption follows a similar pattern: low
at night, peaks in the late morning/afternoon, then decreases again. So the period here is 24
hours—repeating every day.
But wait the question asks "How long is the period of electricity consumption (in Wh)?" So it’s
looking for the duration of the cycle period, not the data’s total duration but the cycle length.
Given the daily repeats, the period is 24 hours.
But need to confirm if the data indeed shows daily periodicity. Let me check across the days. Let’s
take the first three days.
March 11th at 10:00: 543.0 Wh.
March 12th 10:00:526.0.
March13th 10:00:552.0.
Then each day the peak hours of around 10:00-16:00 or so have high values, while nighttime is
lower. Therefore, the repeating cycle is daily, which is 24 hours. Thus, the period is 24 hours.
</think>
{
"summary": "The electricity consumption exhibits a daily periodicity
of 24 hours. Patterns repeat every day with lower consumption during
nighttime and higher consumption during daytime, particularly spiking
around late morning to afternoon hours. This daily cycle is consistent
across all provided data points from March 11th to March 14th."
