Abstract
Recent evaluations of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)
have explored their capabilities in various domains, with only
few benchmarks specifically focusing on urban environments.
Moreover, existing urban benchmarks have been limited to
evaluating LMMs with basic region-level urban tasks under
singular views, leading to incomplete evaluations of LMMs’
abilities in urban environments. To address these issues, we
present UrBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed for
evaluating LMMs in complex multi-view urban scenarios.
UrBench contains 11.6K meticulously curated questions at
both region-level and role-level that cover 4 task dimensions:
Geo-Localization, Scene Reasoning, Scene Understanding,
and Object Understanding, totaling 14 task types. In constructing UrBench, we utilize data from existing datasets and
additionally collect data from 11 cities, creating new annotations using a cross-view detection-matching method. With
these images and annotations, we then integrate LMM-based,
rule-based, and human-based methods to construct largescale high-quality questions. Our evaluations on 21 LMMs
show that current LMMs struggle in the urban environments
in several aspects. Even the best performing GPT-4o lags behind humans in most tasks, ranging from simple tasks such
as counting to complex tasks such as orientation, localization
and object attribute recognition, with an average performance
gap of 17.4%. Our benchmark also reveals that LMMs exhibit
inconsistent behaviors with different urban views, especially
with respect to understanding cross-view relations.

Figure 1: Comparison between UrBench and previous
works. (1) UrBench contains both region-level and role-level
questions, while previous benchmarks generally focus on
region-level questions. (2) In addition to single-view questions in satellite or street view, UrBench also incorporates
cross-view questions. (3) It evaluates LMMs on a comprehensive range of 14 diverse tasks in 4 evaluation dimensions.
benchmarks (Yue et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2023b). The central
purpose behind these explorations is to build human-centric
AI models that can serve as helpful assistants for everyday
life. Given that over 57% of the global population resides in
urban areas (World Bank 2024), it is crucial that these AI
models should be capable of performing a variety of urban
tasks, such as assisting government officials to manage urban development and facilitating citizens to make decisions
in daily life (Zhou et al. 2024b; Feng et al. 2024a). On the
other hand, urban areas are often captured from various perspectives, including the vertical view from satellite or aerial

imagery and the horizontal view from street-view imagery.
To be truly effective in assisting the large urban population,
AI models should also be capable of comprehensively understanding these environments from multiple perspectives.
To better evaluate and develop human-centric AI models,
several works have explored the prospect of LMMs for urban
environments. For example, various works evaluate the capabilities of LMMs on region-level visual recognition (Hao
et al. 2024; Yan et al. 2024) and urban planning (Zhou et al.
2024b). Besides, researchers also examine the performance
of LMMs with remote sensing images (Li, Ding, and Elhoseiny 2024; Kuckreja et al. 2024). However, as shown
in Fig.1, while these studies primarily focus on urban understanding at a region level, they neglect human-centric
tasks within the urban scenarios. A more comprehensive approach should address urban tasks across multiple levels,
from region-level recognition tasks to role-level tasks such
as geo-localization and scene understanding.
Another important aspect of the urban environments is
that they are usually captured by multiple different perspectives. As each perspective offers unique information,
it is vital for LMMs to comprehend different perspectives
to complete certain tasks. For instance, geo-localization
tasks require satellite-view imagery for spatial orientation and street-view imagery for detailed contexts. LMMs
must utilize both perspectives to successfully perform geolocalization. Given the importance of understanding urban
environments from multiple perspectives, current benchmarks that only evaluate LMMs on single-view data (Wang
et al. 2024b; Feng et al. 2024b), as shown in Fig.1, are incomprehensive. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a multiview benchmark to accurately evaluate LMMs under complex urban settings. However, one of the key challenges of
curating such datasets is create annotations for cross-view
scenarios (Zhu, Yang, and Chen 2021; Ye et al. 2024a).
While paired street and satellite images are easy to acquire,
creating questions about cross-view relations remains challenging due to lack of annotations (Li et al. 2023b).
To address these challenges, we propose UrBench, a
multi-task, multi-view benchmark designed for comprehensively evaluating LMMs in urban environments. UrBench
comprises over 11.6K questions across 14 tasks spanning
four dimensions: Geo-Localization, Scene Understanding,
Scene Reasoning, and Object Understanding. UrBench includes both region-level tasks from previous benchmarks
as well as role-level tasks aimed at assisting humans in
daily life. Additionally, considering the multi-view characteristics of urban environments, UrBench incorporates multiple urban perspectives to evaluate LMMs’ capabilities in
understanding complex multi-view relations. In constructing UrBench, we introduce a novel cross-view detection
and matching method to create multi-view annotations. We
then utilized these images and annotations to construct our
high-quality and diverse set of questions with various methods. As shown in Fig.2, our evaluation results indicate that
LMMs lag behind human experts in most tasks, highlighting
their limitations towards human-centric assistants in urban
environments. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

Figure 2: The performances of the 5 leading LMMs, as well
as that of the human and random guess, on UrBench.
• We propose UrBench, a multi-view benchmark designed
to evaluate LMMs’ performances in urban environments.
Our benchmark includes 14 urban tasks that we categorize into various dimensions. These tasks encompass
both region-level evaluations that assess LMMs’ capabilities in urban planning, as well as role-level evaluations
that examine LMMs’ responses to daily issues.
• We introduce a novel benchmark curation pipeline that
involves a cross-view detection-matching algorithm for
object-level annotation generation and a question generation approach that integrates LMM-based, rule-based,
and human-based methods. This pipeline ensures the creation of a large-scale and high-quality corpus of questions, significantly enhancing the diversity and depth of
evaluation across multiple urban tasks.
• We evaluate 21 popular LMMs on UrBench. Our evaluation results show that current models lag behind human
experts in most tasks and reveal LMMs’ inconsistent behaviors with different urban views, which demonstrates
the limitations of current LMMs in urban environments.
Related Work
Large Multimodal Models
Building on the strengths of Large Language Models
(LLMs) (Brown et al. 2020; Touvron et al. 2023) in complex language reasoning and understanding, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can process inputs from multiple
modalities and accomplish sophisticated visual reasoning
and understanding tasks (Yin et al. 2023; Bai et al. 2024).
The rapid growth of LMMs has given rise to both closedsource models like GPT-4o (Achiam et al. 2023) and Gemini (Reid et al. 2024), as well as open-source models such as
LLaVA (Liu et al. 2024b), and VILA (Lin et al. 2024), all

of which have demonstrated significant potential for various
application tasks (Cui et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024).
For urban-related tasks, recent developments show growing interest in utilizing LLMs and CLIP (Radford et al.
2021), covering aspects such as urban planning and visionlanguage navigation (Zhou et al. 2024b; Schumann et al.
2024). For instance, UrbanCLIP (Yan et al. 2024) leverages LLMs (Touvron et al. 2023) and CLIP (Radford et al.
2021) for urban region profiling using remote sensing images, while Velma (Schumann et al. 2024) combines LLMs
with CLIP (Radford et al. 2021) for street view navigation.
Scene-LLM leverages LLMs for multi-view 3D reasoning
in in-door setups, while CityGPT (Feng et al. 2024a) studies
LLMs’ performances in urban spatial understanding tasks.
Multimodal Benchmarks
With the rapid advancement of LMMs, traditional multimodal question answering benchmarks like VQA (Goyal
et al. 2017) and GQA (Hudson and Manning 2019) have
become inadequate for fully assessing LMM capabilities.
Recently, more comprehensive benchmarks are introduced
to better evaluate LMMs. For example, MME (Fu et al.
2023) is one of the first to thoroughly assess LMMs across
14 perception and reasoning tasks. MMMU (Yue et al.
2024) benchmarks expert-level knowledge using collegelevel questions, showing that current models still lag behind
human experts. Newer benchmarks, such as those in (Jiang
et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2024a), focus on multi-image reasoning, and MUIRBench (Wang et al. 2024a) includes tasks
with unanswerable questions. While these works extensively
evaluate LMMs in visual reasoning and multi-image understanding, few analyze performance in urban environments.
Our work fills this gap by constructing a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LMMs’ potential in urban planning, reasoning, and understanding from multi-views.
There is also a growing body of work focused on bench-

marking LMMs in the remote sensing domain. Early efforts
like RSVQA (Lobry et al. 2020) comprises visual recognition tasks such as classification and detection for image
sensing images. EarthVQA (Wang et al. 2024b) feature remote sensing image-question pairs centered on attributes of
ground objects in urban areas. RSIEval (Hu et al. 2023)
and LHRS-Bench (Muhtar et al. 2024) adapt existing remote sensing datasets to create visual reasoning benchmarks
for LMMs, while Geochat (Kuckreja et al. 2024) primarily assesses regional perception capabilities. VRSBench (Li,
Ding, and Elhoseiny 2024) utilizes GPT-4 (Achiam et al.
2023) to generate visual question answering data focused
on object relations. More recently, CityBench (Feng et al.
2024b) evaluates LMMs in urban environments but with a
limited range of tasks. Overall, these existing benchmarks
are limited in task variety and lack multi-view samples.
Moreover, because the image data in these works are primarily repurposed from existing datasets (Xia et al. 2018;
Sun et al. 2022), their geographical diversity is constrained.
In contrast, our benchmark introduces a new pipeline for
collecting multi-view and multi-image data, expanding the
range of tasks and incorporating images from diverse geolocations with multiple perspectives.
UrBench
Benchmark Analysis
Overview. We introduce UrBench, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating LMMs in urban scenarios. As detailed
in Fig.3(c), UrBench comprises 11.6K questions, which are
divided into a validation set for hyperparameter selection
and a test set for evaluation. The validation set and the test
set contain approximately 1.1K and 10.5K questions, respectively. Please refer to the appendix for further statistical details. The UrBench is characterized by the following
features: (1) UrBench integrates street-view, satellite-view,
and street-satellite cross-view images, offering a more com-

UrBench evaluates the capability of LMMs focusing on urban scenarios from comprehensive dimensions, including
Geo-Localization, Scene Reasoning, Scene Understanding,
and Object Understanding, with a total of 14 task types
(Fig.3(a)). (3) The questions of UrBench are generated by
an integrated approach, encompassing model-based, rulebased, and human-based methods, which ensures the generation of a substantial and high-quality corpus of questions.
Comparison with existing benchmarks. While general
benchmarks such as MUIRBench (Wang et al. 2024a) and
MMMU (Yue et al. 2024) evaluate the capacities of LMMs
in general scenarios, typically from a single view, our benchmark is focused on urban scenarios from more different perspectives. On the other hand, unlike existing benchmarks in
urban scenarios such as CityBench (Feng et al. 2024b) and
EarthVQA (Wang et al. 2024b) that place significant emphasis on single-view images and a limited range of tasks, our
benchmark incorporates questions that utilize multi-view
images and cover more diverse task types.
Benchmark Tasks
UrBench comprehensively evaluates LMMs in urban scenarios from four evaluation dimensions. Fig.4 illustrates the
specific task types under each evaluation dimension. Please
refer to the appendix for additional task questions.
Geo-Localization. This dimension contains role-level tasks
widely used in remote-sensing (Zhu, Yang, and Chen 2021),
which requires LMMs to predict geographical coordinates
and directions given images (Task 1-4 in Fig.4). For example, in Image Retrieval (IR), we query LMMs with satellite

d into four evaluation dimensions based on the capacities and
.
or street view images to retrieve their corresponding counterpart, while City Retrieval (CR) tasks LMMs to predict the
name of a city given its satellite or street view images. Orientation (OR) and Camera Localization (CR) require LMMs
to pinpoint directions given cross-view information.
Scene Reasoning. Reasoning about urban scenes is crucial for assisting humans in urban environments. In this dimension, we design three role-level tasks that aim to assess
the reasoning capabilities of LMMs under urban multi-view
scenarios (Task 5-7 in Fig.4). In Visual Prompt Reasoning
(VPR), LMMs must reason about objects framed in visual
prompts, while in Traffic Sign Reasoning (TSR), LMMs predict the usage of traffic signs. To better simulate real-world
human usage, we design Role-based Reasoning to incorporate questions that are posed from the perspective of urban
residents, such as shoppers, visitors, and city managers.
Scene Understanding. To better evaluate LMMs’ capabilities in region-level scene understanding, we design new
tasks as well as adapting existing tasks to urban environments in this dimension, as shown in (Task 8-11 in Fig.4).
For example, to examine whether LMMs can detect common urban regions like crosswalks, we convert the classic
Counting (CO) (Ranjan et al. 2021) task to our specific settings. We design Scene Recognition (SR) and Scene Comparison (SC) to assess LMMs’ region-level understanding of
urban scenes, such as recognizing building types and plant
cover. Additionally, we present Road Understanding (RU),
which is aimed at examining LMMs’ ability in classifying
road types and understanding traffic roads.
Object Understanding. In Object Understanding, we assess
the fine-grained region-level capabilities of LMMs within

Figure 5: UrBench curation pipeline includes data collectio
urban environments (Task 12-14 in Fig.4). Inspired by previous grounding tasks (Yu et al. 2016), we include Object Grounding (OG) to evaluate LMMs’ abilities to ground
text phrases of objects in images across different views. To
further challenge the spatial understanding of LMMs, we
propose Object Matching (OM), a cross-view task where
LMMs predict the locations of objects in satellite and street
views based on their cross-view correspondences. Object
Attribute Recognition (OAR) prompts LMMs to predict
ground object attributes such as building floors and land use.
Benchmark Curation
Data Collection. As outlined in the data collection stage in
Fig.5, there are two data sources of UrBench, the in-house
data collected by ourselves and data from open datasets.
The in-house data contains 2,604 street-view images from
Google Street View and 4,239 satellite-view images from
Google Earth (Level 19). Among these images, 1,965 streetsatellite image pairs are fit together according to their geological coordinates. In addition, each satellite-view image is
equipped with some ground object annotation from OpenStreetMap1. We follow previous works (Zhu, Yang, and
Chen 2021) to ensure no significant temporal differences between satellite and street-view images, which were all collected in 2022-2023. To support more urban tasks, we also
collect images from existing open source datasets, including Cityscapes (Cordts et al. 2016), Mapillary Traffic Sign
Dataset (Ertler et al. 2020), VIGOR dataset (Zhu, Yang, and
Chen 2021), and IM2GPS (Hays and Efros 2008).
Data Pre-processing. In this stage, we process our collected
raw image data to produce annotations for later stages. For
cross-view tasks that require object matching, we develop a
cross-view detection-matching method to obtain paired-up
instance level annotations. Specifically, We first use a pre1https://www.openstreetmap.org

trained Grounding DINO (Liu et al. 2023a) to obtain bounding box annotations for street-view images. Since bounding box annotations for satellite-view images are already
obtained through OSM, we apply ray tracing to map the
street-view boxes to the satellite view. Next, we calculate
the IoUs between the mapped and original satellite-view
boxes and select pairs with IoUs over 0.5 as cross-view
matches. We then employ human checking to further ensure the quality of our matching algorithm. This way, we
effectively align bounding boxes from different views at an
instance level. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive
annotation database by unifying annotations from different
datasets, facilitating data generation and quality control.
Question Generation. Given the nature and requirements of
different tasks, we design three methods to generate question
samples for UrBench. (1) LMM-based. For Scene Reasoning tasks where questions cannot be derived from our annotations, we prompt LMMs to generate Q&A pairs based on
specific task settings. To mitigate bias from LMMs generating and testing their own questions, we diversify our samples by using four different LMMs: GPT-4 (Achiam et al.
2023), Gemini-1.5-Flash (Reid et al. 2024), Claude-3.5Sonnet (Anthropic 2024), and InternVL2-26B (Chen et al.
2024). These samples are then reviewed by humans to eliminate potential hallucinations and ensure quality. (2) Rulebased. For tasks with fixed settings, such as IR and CL,
we generate questions using rule-based templates given the
image annotations, which allows us to automatically convert the annotations into corresponding Q&A pairs, ensuring consistency and efficiency. (3) Human-based. For tasks
like SC where answers cannot be derived from annotations,
we have human annotators determine the ground truths and
generate the Q&A pairs.
Quality Control. At this stage, we employ human checking
to alleviate potential bias during construction of UrBench.
Specifically, for cross-view images, to minimize tempo-

ral inconsistencies, annotators are asked to remove images
with significant temporal changes. During the preprocessing
stage, to reduce potential bias introduced by our cross-view
detection-matching method, human verification ensures the
correctness of paired bounding boxes and filters out mismatched samples. Furthermore, for LMM-generated data,
multiple annotators are engaged to eliminate hallucinations
and maintain data quality. These comprehensive quality control steps ensure the robustness and accuracy of UrBench.
Experiments
In this section, we evaluate various LMMs on our proposed
UrBench. We consider closed-source models, open-source
single-image models and open-source multi-image models,
and perform evaluations under zero-shot settings. In the following sections, we first introduce our evaluated models
evaluation protocols. Then we summarize our findings of
model performance with respect to different model types,
view settings and tasks. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis in terms of different tasks and views.
Evaluation Setups
Evaluated Models. We evaluate 3 closed-source and 18
open-source LMMs across different model types and sizes.
For closed-source models, we consider GPT-4o (Achiam
et al. 2023), Gemini-1.5-Flash (Reid et al. 2024), Claude3.5-Sonnet (Anthropic 2024). For open-sourced models, we
categorize them into single-image type and multi-image type
according to their training data and strategies, including
LLaVA series (Liu et al. 2024a) (Zhou et al. 2024a), XComposer (Zhang et al. 2023), InstructBLIP (Li et al. 2023a)
and idefics (Laurenc¸on et al. 2024) for single-image type,
and Mantis series (Jiang et al. 2024), VILA series (Lin

Evaluation Protocols. In UrBench, our questions have two
response formats: multiple-choice and open-ended. We follow standard setups in MMMU (Yue et al. 2024) and MuirBench (Wang et al. 2024a) to process LMMs’ responses. To
ensure reproducibility, we set the temperature to 0 and perform greedy decoding. Additionally, for models that do not
support multi-image inputs, we concatenate the images as
one input. More details on setups and the human evaluation
protocols are provided in the Appendix.
Main Results
Overall Challenge Presented in UrBench. As indicated
by Table 1, UrBench poses significant challenges to current SoTA LMMs. We find that the best performing closedsource model GPT-4o and open-source model VILA-1.540B only achieve a 61.2% and a 53.1% accuracy, respectively. Interestingly, our findings indicate that the primary
limitation of these models lies in their ability to comprehend
UrBench questions, not in their capacity to process multiple images, as the performance between multi-image and
their single-image counterparts shows little difference, such
as LLaVA-NeXT-8B and LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave in Table
1. Overall, the challenging nature of our benchmark indicates that current LMMs’ strong performance on the general
benchmarks (Fu et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2023b) are not generalized to the multi-view urban scenarios.
LMMs’ performances across task dimensions. In Table
1, we show LMMs performances across different dimensions. We observe that most LMMs exhibit impressive capabilities in Scene Reasoning tasks such as Visual Prompt
Reasoning (VPR) and Role-based Reasoning (RBR), which
are greatly aligned with their SFT objectives (Liu et al.
2024b). In Scene Understanding, models perform relatively
well in region-level tasks such as Scene Recognition (SR)
and Scene Comparison (SC), but are bad at Counting (CO).
While LMMs achieve impressive results in City Retrieval

(CR), however, in other Geo-localization tasks, e.g., Camera Localization (CL) and Orientation (OR), most LMMs
only perform slightly better or worse than random guessing, yielding a 28.6% and a 26.3% average accuracy, respectively. Overall, LMMs’ exception capbilities in reasoning tasks and world knowledge are well-examplified in our
benchmark. However, our benchmark also demonstrates current models’ limited abilities in handling other important urban tasks such as geo-localization.
Are LMMs consistent with Different Views? Out of
the three views in our proposed benchmark, we find that
models struggle the most with cross-view tasks, averaging only 36.2% in all models, while averaging 54.6%
and 42.3 % in street-view and satellite-view, respectively.
Fig.6 presents the overall model performance across different views. Claude-3.5-Sonnet (Anthropic 2024) obtains
the highest 60.1% score in satellite-view. GPT-4o (Achiam
et al. 2023) achieves the highest average score in street-view
tasks, with Gemini-1.5-Flash (Reid et al. 2024), InternVL226B (Chen et al. 2024) and VILA-1.5-40B (Lin et al.
2024) following close. Most models perform no better than
40% in cross-view tasks, except for GPT-4o (Achiam et al.
2023), Claude-3.5-Sonnet (Anthropic 2024) and VILA-1.540B (Lin et al. 2024). Our results show that current LMMs
are best at street-view tasks, while handling satellite-view
and cross-view tasks insufficiently. Future work could incorporate more diverse and relevant training data with multiple
views to help LMMs understand urban scenes holistically.
Does GPT-4o Surpass Human Experts? Human experts
outperform GPT-4o by an average of 17.4% and achieve better performance in 12 out of the 14 UrBench tasks. Humans
only fall significantly behind GPT-4o in the City Retrieval
task, which we attribute to the rich geographic world knowledge in the LMMs. For humans, identifying the correct geographic location from a photo is challenging. GPT-4o falls
behind human experts by 54.1% , on simple tasks such as
counting, and 67.8% on Object Grounding (OG). We note
these gaps highlight the significant room for improvement
in LMMs’ urban understanding capabilities.
Disparity between Closed-source and Open-source Models. Under our urban settings, we observe that the gap between closed-source and open-source models are closing in.
While leading open-source models like VILA-1.5-40B (Lin

et al. 2024) is still behind the leading closed-source model
GPT-4o, VILA-1.5 demonstrates superior performance over
Gemini-1.5-Flash and is close with Claude-3.5. Our results
show the potential of open LMMs as urban assistants.
Detailed Analysis
LMMs struggle to understand cross-view relations. Several UrBench tasks involve understanding the internal relations between satellite and street view images. While prior
works (Shi and Li 2022; Ye et al. 2024b) have demonstrated that specialist models can achieve impressive results
in cross-view tasks such as Camera Localization (CL) and
Orientation (OR), our results indicate that general LMMs
only possess very limited cross-view understanding capability, where their performances in average are only 3% higher
than random. Although LMMs are capable of understanding
relations across multiple images (Jiang et al. 2024), our findings show that their capabilities are yet to generalize to images across views. One potential direction for future work is
to explore multi-view pretraining that aligns multi-view images with text, which enables LMMs to better process and
understand cross-view information (Lin et al. 2024).
LMMs are inconsistent with different views of the same
geolocation. Even though prompted with the same question
at the same geolocation, LMMs behave differently with different views. In City Retrieval (CR), we find that models perform better in street-view (62.9%) and cross-view (63.8%)
compared to satellite-view (50.9%) in average. We conjecture it is because most models are not well-trained on satellite samples and the parametric knowledge of geolocation
is more aligned with street-view images. However, we find
that the results of Scene Recognition SR in satellite-view
are much higher than the other views, as recognizing ground
objects from a vertically upward view is easier than from a
horizontal view. The experiments exhibit the imbalance and
bias between views during the training of LMMs.
Conclusion
In this work, we present UrBench, a new benchmark that
evaluates LMMs in the urban environments with diverse
task types and view types. To create our multi-view annotations, we propose a new data collection pipeline that pairs
up cross-view images at an instance level. In the end, we
collect 11.6K questions that include 14 subtasks of four dimensions. We carefully evaluate 21 LMMs on our questions
and show their limitations in the urban environments. We
conduct extensive analysis on measuring the performance
of LMMs across different view types and task types, and
show that current LMMs still lag behind human experts significantly in the urban environments. We also highlight that
current LMMs struggle to understand multi-view image relations and their performance under different view types are
inconsistent, shedding light on the imbalance and bias between different views during LMMs training. We hope our
work can provide guidance for future work in improving the
capability of LMMs in urban scenarios.
