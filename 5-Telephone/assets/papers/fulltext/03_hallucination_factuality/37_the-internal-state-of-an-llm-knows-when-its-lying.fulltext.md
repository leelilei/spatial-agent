## Extracted Abstract

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various tasks, one of their most prominent drawbacks is generating inaccurate or false information with a confident tone. In this paper, we provide evidence that the LLM’s internal state can be used to reveal the truthfulness of statements. This includes both statements provided to the LLM, and statements that the LLM itself generates. Our approach is to train a classifier that outputs the probability that a statement is truthful, based on the hidden layer activations of the LLM as it reads or generates the statement. Experiments demonstrate that given a set of test sentences, of which half are true and half false, our trained classifier achieves an average of 71% to 83% accuracy labeling which sentences are true versus false, depending on the LLM base model. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between our classifier’s performance and approaches based on the probability assigned to the sentence by the LLM. We show that while LLM-assigned sentence probability is related to sentence truthfulness, this probability is also dependent on sentence length and the frequencies of words in the sentence, resulting in our trained classifier providing a more reliable approach to detecting truthfulness, highlighting its potential to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated content and its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract
While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown exceptional performance in various
tasks, one of their most prominent drawbacks
is generating inaccurate or false information
with a confident tone. In this paper, we provide
evidence that the LLM’s internal state can be
used to reveal the truthfulness of statements.
This includes both statements provided to the
LLM, and statements that the LLM itself generates. Our approach is to train a classifier that
outputs the probability that a statement is truthful, based on the hidden layer activations of
the LLM as it reads or generates the statement.
Experiments demonstrate that given a set of
test sentences, of which half are true and half
false, our trained classifier achieves an average
of 71% to 83% accuracy labeling which sentences are true versus false, depending on the
LLM base model. Furthermore, we explore
the relationship between our classifier’s performance and approaches based on the probability
assigned to the sentence by the LLM. We show
that while LLM-assigned sentence probability
is related to sentence truthfulness, this probability is also dependent on sentence length
and the frequencies of words in the sentence,
resulting in our trained classifier providing a
more reliable approach to detecting truthfulness, highlighting its potential to enhance the
reliability of LLM-generated content and its
practical applicability in real-world scenarios.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated remarkable success in a broad range
of tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Bommarito II and
Katz, 2022; Driess et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023).
However, when composing a response, LLMs tend
to hallucinate facts and provide inaccurate information (Ji et al., 2023). Furthermore, they seem to
provide this incorrect information using confident
and compelling language. The combination of a
broad body of knowledge, along with the provision

classified
as a planet.

result in generating inaccurate information.
of confident but incorrect information, may cause
significant harm, as people may accept the LLM as
a knowledgeable source, and fall for its confident
and compelling language, even when providing
false information.
We believe that in order to perform well, an
LLM must have some internal notion as to whether
a sentence is true or false, as this information is
required for generating (or predicting) following
tokens. For example, consider an LLM generating
the following false information “The sun orbits the
Earth." After stating this incorrect fact, the LLM
is more likely to attempt to correct itself by saying
that this is a misconception from the past. But after
stating a true fact, for example “The Earth orbits
the sun," it is more likely to focus on other planets
that orbit the sun. Therefore, we hypothesize that
the truth or falsehood of a statement should be
represented by, and therefore extractable from, the
LLM’s internal state.
Interestingly, retrospectively “understanding”
that a statement that an LLM has just generated
is false does not entail that the LLM will not generate it in the first place. We identify three reasons for
such behavior. The first reason is that an LLM generates a token at a time, and it “commits” to each

token generated. Therefore, even if maximizing the
likelihood of each token given the previous tokens,
the overall likelihood of the complete statement
may be low. For example, consider a statement
about Pluto. The statement begins with the common words "Pluto is the", then, since Pluto used
to be the smallest planet the word "smallest" may
be a very plausible choice. Once the sentence is
"Pluto is the smallest", completing it correctly is
very challenging, and when prompted to complete
the sentence, GPT-4 (March 23rd version) completes it incorrectly: “Pluto is the smallest dwarf
planet in our solar system.” In fact, Pluto is the second largest dwarf planet in our solar system (after
Eris). One plausible completion of the sentence
correctly is “Pluto is the smallest celestial body
in the solar system that has ever been classified
as a planet.” (see Figure 1). Consider the following additional example: “Tiztoutine is a town in
Africa located in the republic of Niger.” Indeed,
Tiztoutine is a town in Africa, and many countries’
names in Africa begin with “the republic of”. However, Tiztoutine is located in Morocco, which is
not a republic, so once the LLM commits to “the
republic of”, it cannot complete the sentence using
“Morocco", but completes it with “Niger". In addition, committing to a word at a time may lead the
LLM to be required to complete a sentence that it
simply does not know how to complete. For example, when describing a city, it may predict that the
next words should describe the city’s population.
Therefore, it may include in a sentence "Tiztoutine has a population of", but the population size is
not present in the dataset, so it must complete the
sentence with a pure guess.
The second reason for an LLM to provide false
information is that at times, there may be many
ways to complete a sentence correctly, but fewer
ways to complete it incorrectly. Therefore, it might
be that a single incorrect completion may have a
higher likelihood than any of the correct completions (when considered separately).
Finally, since it is common for an LLM to not
use the maximal probability for the next word, but
to sample according to the distribution over the
words, it may sample words that result in false
information.
In this paper we present our Statement Accuracy
Prediction, based on Language Model Activations
(SAPLMA). SAPLMA is a simple yet powerful
method for detecting whether a statement generated

by an LLM is truthful or not. Namely, we build a
classifier that receives as input the activation values
of the hidden layers of an LLM. The classifier determines for each statement generated by the LLM
if it is true or false. Importantly, the classifier is
trained on out-of-distribution data, which allows us
to focus specifically on whether the LLM has an
internal representation of a statement being true or
false, regardless of the statement’s topic.
In order to train SAPLMA we created a dataset
of true and false statements from 6 different topics. Each statement is fed to the LLM, and its
hidden layers’ values are recorded. The classifier
is then trained to predict whether a statement is
true or false only based on the hidden layer’s values. Importantly, our classifier is not tested on
the topics it is trained, but on a held-out topic.
We believe that this is an important measure, as
it requires SAPLMA to extract the LLM’s internal belief, rather than learning how information
must be aligned to be classified as true. We show
that SAPLMA, which leverages the LLM’s internal
states, results in a better performance than prompting the LLM to explicitly state whether a statement
is true or false. Specifically, SAPLMA reaches accuracy levels of between 60% to 80% on specific
topics, while few-shot prompting achieves only
slightly above random performance, with no more
than a 56% accuracy level.
Of course there will be some relationship between the truth/falsehood of a sentence, and the
probability assigned to that sentence by a welltrained LLM. But the probability assigned by an
LLM to a given statement depends heavily on the
frequency of the tokens in the statement as well as
its length. Therefore, sentence probabilities provide only a weak signal of the truth/falsehood of the
sentence. At minimum, they must be normalized
to become a useful signal of the veracity of a statement. As we discuss later, SAPLMA classifications
of truth/falsehood significantly outperform simple
sentence probability. In one test described later in
more detail, we show that SAPLMA performs well
on a set of LLM-generated sentences that contain
50% true, and 50% false statements. We further discuss the relationship between statement probability
and veracity in the discussion section.
SAPLMA employs a simple and relatively shallow feedforward neural network as its classifier,
which requires very little computational power at
inference time. Therefore, it can be computed

alongside the LLM’s output. We propose for
SAPLMA to supplement an LLM presenting information to users. If SAPLMA detects that the
LLM “believes” that a statement that it has just
generated is false, the LLM can mark it as such.
This could raise human trust in the LLM responses.
Alternatively, the LLM may merely delete the incorrect statement and generate a new one instead.
To summarize, the contribution of this paper is
twofold.
• The release of a dataset of true-false statements along with a method for generating
such information.
• Demonstrating that an LLM might “know”
when a statement that it has just generated
is false, and proposing SAPLMA, a method
for extracting this information.
2 Related Work
In this section we provide an overview of previous research on LLM hallucination, accuracy, and
methods for detecting false information, and we
discuss datasets used to that end.
Many works have focused on hallucination in
machine translation (Dale et al., 2022; Ji et al.,
2023). For example, Dale et al. (Dale et al.,
2022) consider hallucinations as translations that
are detached from the source, hence they propose a
method that evaluates the percentage of the source
contribution to a generated translation. If this contribution is low, they assume that the translation is
detached from the source and is thus considered to
be hallucinated. Their method improves detection
accuracy hallucinations. The authors also propose
to use multilingual embeddings, and compare the
similarity between the embeddings of the source
sentence and the target sentence. If this similarity
is low, the target sentence is considered to be hallucinated. The authors show that the latter method
works better. However, their approach is very different than ours, as we do not assume any pair of
source and target sentences. In addition, while we
also use the internal states of the model, we do so
by using the hidden states to descriminate between
statements that the LLM “believes” are true and
those that are false. Furtheremore, we focus on
detecting false statements rather than hallucination,
as defined by their work.
Other works have focused on hallucination in
text summarization (Pagnoni et al., 2021). Pagnoni
et al. propose a benchmark for factuality metrics of

text summarization. Their benchmark is developed
by gathering summaries from several summarization methods and requested humans to annotate
their errors. The authors analyze these anotation
and the proportion of the different factual error of
the summarization methods. We note that most
works that consider hallucination do so with relation to a given input (e.g., a passage) that the model
operates on. For example, a summarization model
that outputs information that does not appear in the
provided article, is considered hallucinate it, regardless if the information is factually true. However,
in this work we consider a different problem—-the
veracity of the output of an LLM, without respect
to a specific input.
Some methods for reducing hallucination assume that the LLM is a black box (Peng et al.,
2023). This approach uses different methods for
prompting the LLM, possibly by posting multiple
queries for achieving better performance. Some
methods that can be used for detecting false statements may include repeated queries and measuring
the discrepancy among them. We note that instead
of asking the LLM to answer the same query multiple times, it is possible to request the LLM to
rephrase the query (without changing its meaning
or any possible answer) and then asking it to answer each rephrased question.
Other methods finetune the LLM, using human
feedback, reinforcement learning, or both (Bakker
et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). Ouyang et al.
propose a method to improve LLM-generated content using reinforcement learning from human feedback. Their approach focuses on fine-tuning the
LLM with a reward model based on human judgments, aiming to encourage the generation of better content. However, fine tuning, in general, may
cause a model to not perform as well on other tasks
(Kirkpatrick et al., 2017). In this paper, we take an
intermediate approach, that is, we assume access to
the model parameters, but do not fine-tune or modify them. Another approach that can be applied to
our settings is presented by (Burns et al., 2022),
named Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS). However, CCS requires rephrasing a statement into a
question, evaluating the LLM on two different version of the prompt, and requires training data from
the same dataset (topic) as the test set. These limitations render it unsuitable for running in practice
on statements generated by an LLM. In addition,
CCS increases the accuracy by only approximately

4% over the 0-shot LLM query, while our approach
demonstrates a nearly 20% increase over the 0-shot
LLM
A dataset commonly used for training and finetuning LLMs is the Wizard-of-Wikipedia (Dinan
et al., 2018). The Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset includes interactions between a human apprentice
and a human wizard. The human wizard receives
relevant Wikipedia articles, which should be used
to select a relevant sentence and compose the response. The goal is to replace the wizard with a
learned agent (such as an LLM). Another highly
relevant dataset is FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018,
2019). The FEVER dataset is designed for developing models that receive as input a claim and a
passage, and must determine whether the passage
supports the claim, refutes it, or does not provide
enough information to support or refute it. While
the FEVER dataset is highly relevant, it does not
provide simple sentence that are clearly true or
false independently of a provided passage. In addition, the FEVER dataset is not partitioned into
different topics as the true-false dataset provided in
this paper.
In conclusion, while several approaches have
been proposed to address the problem of hallucination and inaccuracy in automatically generated
content, our work is unique in its focus on utilizing
the LLM’s hidden layer activations to determine
the veracity of generated statements. Our method
offers the potential for more general applicability in
real-world scenarios, operating alongside an LLM,
without the need for fine-tuning or task-specific
modifications.
3 The True-False Dataset
The work presented in this paper requires a dataset
of true and false statements. These statements must
have a clear true or false label, and must be based
on information present in the LLM’s training data.
Furthermore, since our approach intends to reveal
that the hidden states of an LLM have a notion of
a statement being true or false, the dataset must
cover several disjoint topics, such that a classifier
can be trained on the LLM’s activations of some
topics while being tested on another. Unfortunately,
we could not find any such dataset and therefore,
compose the true-false dataset.
Our true-false dataset covers the following topics: “Cities", “Inventions", “Chemical Elements",
“Animals", “Companies", and “Scientific Facts".

For the first 5 topics, we used the following method
to compose the dataset. We used a reliable source1
that included a table with several properties for
each instance. For example, for the “chemical elements" we used a table that included, for each
element, its name, atomic number, symbol, standard state, group block, and a unique property (e.g.,
Hydrogen, 1, H, Gas, Nonmetal, the most abundant element in the universe). For each element we
composed true statement using the element name
and one of its properties (e.g., “The atomic number
of Hydrogen is 1”). Then, we randomly selected a
different row for composing a false statement (e.g.,
“The atomic number of Hydrogen is 34”). If the
value in the different row is identical to the value in
the current row, we resample a different row until
we obtain a value that is different. This process
was repeated for the all topics except the “Scientific Facts”. For the “Scientific Facts” topic, we
asked ChatGPT (Feb 13 version) to provide “scientific facts that are well known to humans” (e.g.
“The sky is often cloudy when it’s going to rain”).
We then asked ChatGPT to provide the opposite of
each statement such that it becomes a false statement (e.g., “The sky is often clear when it’s going
to rain”). The statements provided by ChatGPT
were manually curated, and verified by two human annotators. The classification of 48 facts were
questioned by at least one of the annotators; these
facts were removed from the dataset. The truefalse dataset comprises 6,084 sentences, including
1,458 sentences for “Cities", 876 for “Inventions",
930 for “Chemical Elements", 1,008 for “Animals",
1,200 for “Companies", and 612 for “Scientific
Facts". The following are some examples of true
statements from the dataset:
• Cities: “Oranjestad is a city in Aruba”
• Inventions: “Grace Hopper invented the
COBOL programming language”
• Animals: “The llama has a diet of herbivore”
• Companies: “Meta Platforms has headquarters in United States”
• Scientific Facts: “The Earth’s tides are primarily caused by the gravitational pull of the
moon”
The following are some examples of false statements from the dataset:
1Cities: Downloaded from simplemaps. Inventions: Obtained from Wikipedia list of inventors. Chemical Elements:
Downloaded from pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov periodic-table.
Animals: Obtained from kids national geographics. Companies: Forbes Global 2000 List 2022: The Top 200.

• Chemical Elements: “Indium is in the Lanthanide group”
• Animals: “The whale has a long, tubular
snout, large ears, and a powerful digging ability to locate and consume termites and ants.”
• Scientific Facts: “Ice sinks in water due to its
higher density”
Other candidates for topics to be added to the
dataset include sports, celebrities, and movies. The

4 SAPLMA
In this section, we present our Statement Accuracy
Prediction, based on Language Model Activations
(SAPLMA), a method designed to determine the
truthfulness of statements generated by an LLM
using the values in its hidden layers. Our general
hypothesis is that the values in the hidden layers of
an LLM contain information on whether the LLM
“believes” that a statement is true or false. However,
it is unclear which layer should be the best candidate for retaining such information. While the last
hidden layer should contain such information, it
is primarily focused on generating the next token.
Conversely, layers closer to the input are likely focused on extracting lower-level information from
the input. Therefore, we use several hidden layers
as candidates. We use two different LLMs: Facebook OPT-6.7b (Zhang et al., 2022) and LLAMA27b (Roumeliotis et al., 2023); both composed of
32 layers. For each LLM, we compose five different models, each using activations from a different
layer. Namely, we use the last hidden layer, the
28th layer (which is the 4th before last), the 24th
layer (which is the 8th before last), the 20th layer
(which is the 12th before last), and the middle layer
(which is the 16th layer). We note that each layer
is composed of 4096 hidden units.
SAPLMA’s classifier employs a feedforward
neural network, featuring three hidden layers with
decreasing numbers of hidden units (256, 128, 64),
all utilizing ReLU activations. The final layer is a
sigmoid output. We use the Adam optimizer. We
do not fine-tune any of these hyper-parameters for
this task. The classifier is trained for 5 epochs.
For each topic in the true-false dataset, we train
the classifier using only the activation values obtained from all other topics and test its accuracy on
the current topic. This way, the classifier is required
to determine which sentences the LLM “believes”

are true and which it “believes” are false, in a general setting, and not specifically with respect to the
topic being tested. To obtain more reliable results,
we train each classifier three times with different
initial random weights. This process is repeated for
each topic, and we report the accuracy mean over
these three runs.
5 Results
We compare the performance of SAPLMA against
three different baselines. The first is BERT, for
which we train a classifier (with an identical architecture to the one used by SAPLMA) on the BERT
embeddings of each sentence. Our second baseline
is a few shot-learner using OPT-6.7b. This baseline is an attempt to reveal whether the LLM itself
“knows” whether a statement is true or false. Unfortunately, any attempts to explicitly prompt the
LLM in a ‘zero-shot” manner to determine whether
a statement is true or false completely failed with
accuracy levels not going beyond 52%. Therefore,
we use a few shot-query instead, which provided
the LLM with truth values from the same topic
it is being tested on. Note that this is very different from our methodology, but was necessary
for obtaining some results. Namely, we provided
few statements along with the ground-truth label,
and then the statement in question. We recorded
the probability that the LLM assigned to the token
“true” and to the token “false”. Unfortunately, the
LLM had a tendency to assign higher values to the
“true” token; therefore, we divided the probability
assigned to the “true” token by the one assigned
to the “false” token. Finally, we considered the
LLM’s prediction “true” if the value was greater
than the average, and “false” otherwise. We tested
a 3-shot and a 5-shot version. The third baseline,
given a statement ‘X’, we measure the probabilities
(using OPT-6.7) of the sentences “It is true that X”,
and “It is false that X”, and pick the higher probability (considering only the probabilities for X, not
the added words). This normalizes the length and
frequency factors.
Table 1 and Figure 2 present the accuracy of
all the models tested using the OPT-6.7b LLM,
for each of the topics, along with the average accuracy. As depicted by the table and figure, SAPLMA
clearly outperforms BERT and Few-shot learning,
with BERT, 3-shot, and 5-shot learning achieving only slightly above a random guess (0.50). It
can also be observed that SAPLMA for OPT-6.7b

seems to work best when using the 20th layer (out
of 32). Recall that each model was trained three
times. We note that the standard deviation between
the accuracy among the different runs was very
small; therefore, the differences in performance
between the different layers seem consistent. However, the optimal layer to be used for SAPLMA is
very likely to depend on the LLM.
We note that the average training accuracy for
SAPLMA (using OPT-6.7b’s 20th layer) is 86.4%.
We believe that this relatively high value may indicate once again that the veracity of a statement is inherit to the LLM. To demonstrate this, we run a test
where the true/false labels are randomly permuted.
The average accuracy on the random training data
is only 62.5%. This indicates that our model does
not have the capacity to completely over-fit the
training data, and thus, must exploit structure and
patterns that appear in the data.
Additionally, Table 2 presents the performance
of SAPLMA using LLAMA2-7b. As expected,
SAPLMA using LLAMA2-7b achieves much better performance. Interestingly, for LLAMA2-7b,
the middle layer performs best.

Table 2: Accuracy classifying truthfulness of externally
generated sentences using SAPLMA with LLAMA2-7b.
The table shows accuracy of all the models tested for
each of the topics, and the average accuracy.
As for the differences between the topics, we
believe that these values depend very much on the
training data of the LLM. That is, we believe that
the data used for training OPT-6.7b and LLAMA27b includes information or stories about many cities
and companies, and not as much on chemical elements and animals (other than the very common
ones). Therefore, we conjecture that is the reason
SAPLMA achieves high accuracy for the “cities”
topic (while trained on all the rest) and the “companies” topic, but achieves much lower accuracy
when tested on the “animals” and “elements” topics.
In addition to the topics from the true-false
dataset, we also created a second data set of statements generated by the LLM itself (the OPT-6.7b
model). For generating statements, we provided
a true statement not present in the dataset, and allowed the LLM to generate a following statement.
We first filtered out any statements that were not
factual statements (e.g., “I’m not familiar with the
Japanese versions of the games.”). All statements
were generated using the most probable next word
at each step, i.e., we did not use sampling. This
resulted in 245 labeled statements. The statements
were fact-checked and manually labeled by three
human judges based on web-searches. The human
judges had a very high average observed agreement of 97.82%, and an average Cohen’s Kappa of
0.9566. The majority determined the ground-truth
label for each statement. 48.6% of the statements
were labeled as true, resulting in a balanced dataset.
Each of the models was trained 14 times using
the same classifier described in Section 4. The
models were trained on the entire true-false dataset
(i.e., all topics, but not the generated sentences) and
tested on the generated sentences.
Table 3 presents the average accuracy of all models on the sentences generated by the LLM. As
anticipated, SAPLMA (using OPT-6.7b) clearly
outperforms the baselines, which appear to be entirely ineffectual in this task, achieving an accuracy

near 50%. However, the accuracy of SAPLMA on
these sentences is not as promising as the accuracy
achieved when tested on some of the topics in the
true-false dataset (i.e., the cities and companies).
Since we expected the LLM to generate sentences
that are more aligned with the data it was trained
on, we did expect SAPLMA’s performance on the
generated sentences to be closer to its performance
on topics such as cities and companies, which are
likely aligned with the data the LLM was trained
on. However, there may be also a counter-effect in
play: the sentences in the true-false dataset were
mostly generated using a specific pattern (except
the scientific facts topic), such that each sentence is
clearly either true or false. However, the sentences
generated by the LLM where much more open,
and their truth value may be less clearly defined
(despite being agreed upon by the human judges).
For example, one of the sentences classified by all
human judges as false is “Lima gets an average of
1 hour of sunshine per day.” However, this sentence is true during the winter. Another example is
“Brink is a river,” which was also classified as false
by all three human judges; however, brink refers to
river bank (but is not a name of a specific river, and
does not mean river). Indeed, SAPLMA classified
approximately 70% of the sentences as true, and the
AUC values seem more promising. This may hint
that any sentence that seems plausible is classified
as true. Therefore, we evaluate the models using
30% of the generated sentences for determining
which threshold to use, i.e., any prediction above
the threshold is considered true. Importantly, we
do not use this validation set for any other goal. We
test the models on the remaining 70% of the generated sentences. We do not evaluate the few shot
models again, as our evaluation guaranteed that the

number of positive predictions would match the
number of negative predictions, which matches the
distribution in of the data.
Model Avg Threshold Accuracy
last-layer 0.8687 0.7052
28th-layer 0.8838 0.7134
24th-layer 0.8801 0.6988

middle-layer 0.8123 0.650
BERT 0.9403 0.5705
Table 4: Accuracy classifying truthfulness of sentences
generated by the LLM itself. Unlike the data in Table
3, where a threshold of 0.5 on the classifier output was
used to classify sentences as true or false, in this table the results were obtained by estimating the optimal
threshold from a held-out validation data set (30% of
the original test-set).
Table 4 presents the accuracy of all models when
using the optimal threshold from the validation set.
Clearly, SAPLMA performs better with a higher
threshold. This somewhat confirms our assumption
that the truth value of the sentences generated by
the LLM is more subjective than those that appear
in the true-false dataset. We note that also the
BERT embeddings perform better with a higher
threshold. The use of a higher threshold can also
be justified by the notion that it is better to delete
or to mark as unsure a sentence that is actually true,
than to promote false information.
Another interesting observation is that the 20thlayer no longer performs best for the statements
generated by the LLM, but the 28th layer seems to
perform best. This is somewhat perplexing and we
do not have a good guess as to why this might be
happening. Nevertheless, we stress that the differences between the accuracy levels of the 28th-layer
and the others are statistically significant (using a
two-tailed student t-test; p < 0.05). In future work
we will consider fusing multiple layers together,
and using the intermediate activation values outputted by the LLM for all the words appearing in
the statement (rather than using only the LLM’s
output for the final word).
We also ran the statements generated by the
OPT 6.7b model on GPT-4 (March 23rd version),
prompting it to determine whether each statement
was true or false. Specifically, we provided the
following prompt “Copy the following statements
and for each statement write true if it is true and

false if it is false:”, and fed it 30 statements at a
time. It achieved an accuracy level of 84.4%, and a
Cohen’s Kappa agreement level of 0.6883 with the
true label.
6 Discussion
In this work we explicitly do not consider models
that were trained or fine-tuned on data from the
same topic of the test-set. This is particularly important for the sentences generated by the LLM, as
training on a held-out set from them would allow
the classifier to learn which type of sentences generated by the LLM are generally true, and which
are false. While this information may be useful
in practice, and its usage is likely to yield much
higher accuracy, it deviates from this paper’s focus.
We note that the probability of the entire sentence (computed by multiplying the conditional
probabilities of each word, given the previous
words) cannot be directly translated to a truth value
for the sentence, as many words are more common
than others. Therefore, while sentence probabilities
may be useful to determine which of two similar
sentences is true, they cannot be used alone for the
general purpose of determining the truthfulness of
a given sentence.
In Table 5 we compare the probability assigned
by the LLM and the sigmoid output from SAPLMA
on 14 statements, which do not appear in the truefalse dataset. We use the 28-layer, as it proved
to perform best on the statements generated by
the LLM, but we note that other layers provide
very similar results on this set of statements. As
depicted by the table, the probabilities provided
by the LLM are highly susceptible to the syntax,
i.e., the exact words and the statement’s length.
The first two sets of examples in the table illustrate
how sentence length highly affects the probabilities,
but not SPLMA. In the following examples the
false statements are not necessarily shorter than the
true statements, yet the probabilities remain highly
unreliable, while SPLMA generally succeeds in
making accurate predictions.
The statement “The Earth is flat” as well as “The
Earth is flat like a pancake” probably appear several
times in the LLM’s training data, therefore, it has a
relatively high probability; however, SAPLMA is
not baffled by it and is almost certain that both sentences are false. A basketeer is a rare word meaning
a basketball player. It seems that the LLM is not
familiar with the phrase and assigns it a low proba-

bility. However, while SAPLMA still classifies the
statement “Kevin Durant is basketeer” as false, it’s
still much more confident that Kevin Durant is not
a baseball player, in contrast to the probabilities.
Since the statement “Kevin Duarnt is basketball
player” has a typo, its probability is extremely low,
but SAPLMA still classifies the statement as true.
“Jennifer Aniston is a female person” is an implicit truth, a fact that is universally acknowledged
without needing to be explicitly stated; thus, it is
unlikely to be mentioned in the LLM’s training data.
Therefore, its probability is very low—much lower
than “Jennifer Aniston is not an actress”—despite
having the same number of words. Nevertheless,
SAPLMA classifies it correctly, albeit not with very
high confidence.
While we show that the probabilities cannot be
used alone to determine the veracity of a statement,
they are not useless and do convey important information. Therefore, in future work we will consider
providing SAPLMA with the probabilities of the
generated words; however, this information may be
redundant, especially if SAPLMA uses the intermediate activation values for all the words appearing
in the statement.

7 Conclusions & Future Work
In this paper, we tackle a fundamental problem
associated with LLMs, i.e., the generation of incorrect and false information. We have introduced
SAPLMA, a method that leverages the hidden layer
activations of an LLM to predict the truthfulness

of generated statements. We demonstrated that
SAPLMA outperforms few-shot prompting in detecting whether a statement is true or false, achieving accuracy levels between 60% to 80% on specific topics when using OPT-6.7b, and between
70% to 90% when using LLAMA2-7b. This is a
significant improvement over the maximum 56%
accuracy level achieved by few-shot prompting (for
OPT-6.7b).
Our findings suggest that LLMs possess an internal representation of statement accuracy, which
can be harnessed by SAPLMA to filter out incorrect information before it reaches the user, and
furthermore that this representation of accuracy
is very different from the probability assigned to
the sentence by the LLM. Using SAPLMA as a
supplement to LLMs may increase human trust
in the generated responses and mitigate the risks
associated with the dissemination of false information. Furthermore, we have released the true-false
dataset and proposed a method for generating such
data. This dataset, along with our methodology,
provides valuable resources for future research in
improving LLMs’ abilities to generate accurate and
reliable information.
In future work we intend to apply our method
to larger LLMs, and run experiments with humans,
such that a control group will interact with an unfiltered LLM, and the experimental group will interact with a system that augments SAPLMA and an
LLM. We hope to demonstrate that humans trust
and better understand the limitations of a system
that is able to review itself and mark statements that
it is unsure about. We also intend to study how the
activations develop over time as additional words
are generated, and consider multilingual input.
8 Limitations
This paper focuses on detecting whether a statement is true or false. However, in practice, it may
be more beneficial to detect if the LLM is positive
that a statement is correct or if it is unsure. The
most simple adjustment to the proposed method in
this paper is to lift the required threshold for classifying a statement as true above 0.5; however, the
exact value would require some form of calibration
of the model (Bella et al., 2010). Another option
is to use multiple classifiers and to require all (or
a vast majority of) classifiers to output “true”, for
the statement to be considered true. Alternatively,
dropout layers can be used for the same goal (Chen

and Yi, 2021). The overall system can benefit from
multiple outcomes, such that if the LLM is not positive whether the statement is true or false, it can be
marked for the user to treat with caution. However,
if a statement is classified as false, the LLM can
delete it and generate a different statement instead.
To avoid regenerating the same statement again, the
probability of sampling the words that appear in the
current statement should be adjusted downward.
Our work was only tested in English. However,
we believe that a multilingual LLM can be trained
on one language and applied on statements in another language. We will test this hypothesis in
future work.
In our work, we collected the activation values when each sentence was generated separately.
However, in practice, in an LLM generating longer
responses the activation values develop over time,
so they may process both correct and incorrect information. Therefore, the activation values would
need to be decoupled so that they can be tested
whether the most recent statement was true or false.
One approach might be to subtract the value of the
activations obtained after the previous statement
from the current activation values (a discrete derivative). Clearly, training must be performed using the
same approach.
9 Ethical Impact
One of the primary ethical concerns of LLMs is
the generation of false information; yet, we believe
that SAPLMA could potentially reduce this issue.
On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge
that certain ethical issues, such as bias, may persist, potentially being transferred from the LLM to
SAPLMA. Specifically, if the LLM exhibits bias
towards certain ethnic groups, SAPLMA may likewise classify statements as true or false based on
these inherited biases from the original LLM. Nevertheless, it may be possible to adapt the approach
presented in this paper to bias mitigation.
