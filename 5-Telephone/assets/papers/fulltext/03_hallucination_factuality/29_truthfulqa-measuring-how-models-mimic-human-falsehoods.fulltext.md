Abstract
We propose a benchmark to measure whether
a language model is truthful in generating answers to questions. The benchmark comprises
817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. We
crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid
generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J,
GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model
was truthful on 58% of questions, while human performance was 94%. Models generated
many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive
humans. The largest models were generally
the least truthful. This contrasts with other
NLP tasks, where performance improves with
model size. However, this result is expected if
false answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up models
alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives
other than imitation of text from the web.

1 Introduction
There is growing interest in using language models
to generate text for practical applications. Large
companies are deploying their own models (Raffel
et al., 2019; Fedus et al., 2021), and hundreds of
organizations are deploying GPT-3 via APIs from
OpenAI and other firms (OpenAI, 2020; Wolf et al.,
2020; CohereAI, 2021; OpenAI, 2021). While recent language models are impressively fluent, they
have a tendency to generate false statements. These
range from subtle inaccuracies to wild hallucinations (Shuster et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Krishna et al., 2021). This leads to three concerns:
2202
yaM

]LC.sc[
2v85970.9012:viXra

1. Accidental misuse. Due to lack of rigorous
testing, deployed models make false statements to users. This could lead to deception
and distrust (Tamkin et al., 2021).
2. Blocking positive applications. In applications like medical or legal advice, there are
high standards for factual accuracy. Even if
models have relevant knowledge, people may
avoid deploying them without clear evidence
they are reliably truthful.
3. Malicious misuse. If models can generate
plausible false statements in ways that are
not easily identifiable, they could be used to
deceive humans via disinformation or fraud
(Zellers et al., 2019; Schuster et al., 2019).
By contrast, models that are reliably truthful
would be harder to deploy for deceptive uses.
To address these concerns, it is valuable to quantify how truthful models are. In particular: How
likely are models to make false statements across a
range of contexts and questions? Better measurement will help in producing more truthful models
and in understanding the risks of deceptive models.
This raises a basic question: Why do language
models generate false statements? One possible
cause is that the model has not learned the training
distribution well enough. When asked the question,
“What is 1241 × 123?”, GPT-3 outputs “14812”.
GPT-3 fails to reliably generalize from its training data about multiplication (Brown et al., 2020).
Another possible cause (which doesn’t apply to
multiplication) is that the model’s training objective actually incentivizes a false answer. We call
such false answers imitative falsehoods. For GPT-3
a false answer is an imitative falsehood if it has
high likelihood on GPT-3’s training distribution.
Figure 1 illustrates questions from TruthfulQA that
we think cause imitative falsehoods.

reason to focus on imitative falsehoods is that
they are less likely to be covered by existing
question-answering benchmarks (Clark et al., 2018;
Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2017;
Hendrycks et al., 2020). Another reason is that
scaling laws suggest that scaling up models will reduce perplexity on the training distribution (Kaplan
et al., 2020). This will decrease the rate of falsehoods that arise from not learning the distribution
well enough (such as the multiplication example).
Yet this should increase the rate of imitative falsehoods, a phenomenon we call “inverse scaling”.
Imitative falsehoods pose a problem for language
models that is not solved merely by scaling up.

Baselines have low truthfulness. We tested
GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-Neo/J (Wang
and Komatsuzaki, 2021), and UnifiedQA (based on
T5 (Khashabi et al., 2020) under a range of model
sizes and prompts. Under human evaluation, the
best-performing model (GPT-3-175B with “helpful”
prompt) was truthful on 58% of questions, while
human performance was 94% (Fig. 4). This model
also generated answers that were both false and
informative 42% of the time (compared to 6% for
the human baseline). Such informative answers,
which often mimic popular misconceptions, are
more likely to deceive.
Appendix B.3 shows additional results for new
language models that were released after the initial rollout of TruthfulQA (and that are therefore
excluded from our main conclusions). While the
new mechanisms introduced in each model lead to
better performance on the benchmark, there is still
a large performance gap between the best model
and the human baseline.

ent model families, the largest models were generally less truthful (Fig. 2). This “inverse scaling”
trend contrasts with most tasks in NLP, where performance improves with model size (Brown et al.,
2020; Kaplan et al., 2020). One explanation of
this result is that larger models produce more imitative falsehoods because they are better at learning
the training distribution. Another explanation is
that our questions adversarially exploit weaknesses
in larger models not arising from imitation of the
training distribution. We ran experiments aimed to
tease apart these explanations (Section 4.3).

human evaluations of whether an answer is true or

models (Section 4.4). Along with the multiplechoice task (Section 3.1), this metric provides a
quick and reproducible way to assess models.

2 The TruthfulQA Benchmark
2.1 Defining the truthfulness objective
TruthfulQA aims to measure the truthfulness of a
model (Evans et al., 2021). We use a strict standard,
where a claim counts as true if it describes the literal truth about the real world. Claims that are only
true according to a belief system or tradition (e.g.
“Libras have friendly personalities”) are counted as
false. TruthfulQA mostly concerns factual claims,
and true factual claims are usually supported by
reliable, publicly available evidence. Overall, our
standard for truth is similar to the standards used
for scientific articles or Wikipedia. As an illustration of our standard, see Figure 1 (which shows
only answers that we count as false) and Figure 16
(which shows both true and false answers).
How do we evaluate models using this standard
of truth? Statements generated by models may be
ambiguous or inaccurate to varying degrees. We assign statements a scalar truth score in [0, 1], which
can be interpreted as the probability the statement
is true. Results in Figures 2 and 4 threshold these
scores for greater interpretability but scalar scores
are reported in Appendix B.2.
We define an answer to a question as truthful iff it
avoids asserting a false statement. So truthfulness
is consistent with refusing to answer a question,
with expressing uncertainty, or with giving a true
but irrelevant answer. In this paper, we evaluate
non-committal answers such as “No comment” or
“I don’t know” as true, even when there’s a sense in
which the model “knows” a true answer.1 It follows
from our definition that a model is perfectly truthful
if it answers “No comment” for every question. In
practice we want answers that are both truthful
and informative (i.e. providing information that
reduces uncertainty raised by the question). So in
assessing models, we also include evaluations of
informativeness. Truthfulness and informativeness
are loosely analogous to precision and recall.
2.2 Constructing TruthfulQA
TruthfulQA consists of a test set of 817 questions
and is intended only for the zero-shot setting. All
questions were written by the authors and were designed to elicit imitative falsehoods. The questions
are diverse in style and cover 38 categories, where
1Given the current state of research on interpretability, it
would be hard to systematically decide whether a language
model really “knows” an answer such that it could be generated by the model under different conditions or prompting.

diversity is important because a truthful model
should be truthful regardless of the topic.
Most questions are one-sentence long with a median length of 9 words. Each question has sets
of true and false reference answers and a source
that supports the answers (e.g. a Wikipedia page).
The reference answers are used for human evaluation, automated evaluation (see Section 3.2), and a
multiple-choice task (Section 3.1). Their construction is described in Appendix C.1.
The questions in TruthfulQA were designed to
be “adversarial” in the sense of testing for a weakness in the truthfulness of language models (rather
than testing models on a useful task). In particular,
the questions test a weakness to imitative falsehoods: false statements with high likelihood on the
training distribution. We constructed the questions
using the following adversarial procedure, with
GPT-3-175B (QA prompt) as the target model:
1. We wrote questions that some humans would
answer falsely. We tested them on the target model and filtered out questions that the
model consistently answered correctly when
multiple random samples were generated at
nonzero temperatures. We produced 437 questions this way, which we call the “filtered”
questions (Wallace and Boyd-Graber, 2018).
2. Using this experience of testing on the target model, we wrote 380 additional questions
that we expected some humans and models to
answer falsely. Since we did not test on the
target model, these are “unfiltered” questions.
We report results on the combined filtered and
unfiltered questions. For non-combined results, see
Appendix B.4. The questions produced by this adversarial procedure may exploit weaknesses that
are not imitative. For example, the target model
might answer a question falsely because it has unusual syntax and not because the false answer was
learned during training. We describe experiments
to tease apart these possibilities in Section 4.3.
2.3 Validating TruthfulQA
The questions and reference answers in TruthfulQA
were written by the authors. To estimate the percentage of questions on which an independent user
might disagree with our evaluations, we recruited
two external researchers to perform the following
validation:

1. A “validator” was shown a random sample
of 100 questions from TruthfulQA with one
true and one false reference answer given per
question. They were asked to decide which
of the two answers was true and to describe
any disagreements. They disagreed on 7% of
questions.
2. A “participant” was asked to answer 250 randomly sampled questions from TruthfulQA
with a suggested time of 2 minutes per question and access to the internet. Following
the evaluation procedure in Appendix D, we
marked 6% of their answers as false. The
participant’s answers were also used as the
human baseline for our experiments.
These results suggest disagreement with 6-7%
of our reference answers. However, in both cases
we suspect the external researcher made some mistakes (e.g. due to insufficient time) which inflated
the apparent level of disagreement. Regardless, this
level of disagreement would not affect our main results, as the differences in scores between baseline
models generally exceed this range. The details
of the validation procedure are described in Appendix F.
3 Experiments
3.1 Models and prompts
To compute baselines for TruthfulQA, we evaluate
four model families:
1. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is trained on filtered Common Crawl and other sources.
2. GPT-Neo/J (Black et al., 2021; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021) is a variant of GPT-3 with a
different training set (Gao et al., 2020).
3. GPT-2 is trained on WebText (Radford et al.,
2019).
4. UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020) is a T5
model (Raffel et al., 2019) fine-tuned on diverse QA tasks. This is a different transformer architecture, training objective, and
pre-training dataset than the other models.
For each model family, we evaluate different
sizes of model. For GPT-3-175B only, we evaluate
different prompts.
Appendix B.3 presents additional results from
the Anthropic (Askell et al., 2021), Gopher (Rae

et al., 2021), WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), and
InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2021) models, which
were externally evaluated on TruthfulQA.
Prompts. TruthfulQA is intended as a zero-shot
benchmark (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021).
Zero-shot means that (i) no gradient updates are
performed and (ii) no examples from TruthfulQA
appear in prompts (but prompts may contain natural
language instructions). For our baselines, we also
require that prompts and hyperparameters are not
tuned on examples from TruthfulQA in any way.
We call this the true zero-shot setting, following
the definition of “true few-shot learning” in Perez
et al. (2021). For straightforward comparison to
our true-zero-shot baselines, we recommend using
our prompts and hyperparameters.2
The default prompt for our experiments is an
existing question-answering prompt taken from the
OpenAI API (“QA prompt”) (OpenAI, 2020) with
minor formatting changes. The prompt consists of
trivia questions that are dissimilar from TruthfulQA
in style and content. This prompt is used for all
model families and sizes except for the UnifiedQA
family. No prompt is used for UnifiedQA, as it is
already fine-tuned for question-answering.
Additional prompts are tested on GPT-3-175B
only. Appendix E contains the set of all prompts.
In our main results, we focus on the ‘helpful’ and
‘harmful’ prompt, which encourage models to be
more or less truthful, respectively.
3.2 Tasks and evaluation
Main task: generation. Our main task involves
natural language generation. A model generates
a full-sentence answer given a prompt and question. Answers are generated using greedy decoding
(i.e. temperature set to zero). Model and sampling
parameters are otherwise unchanged from the defaults in the OpenAI API (GPT-3; OpenAI, 2020)
or the HuggingFace API (GPT-2, GPT-Neo/J, UnifiedQA; Wolf et al., 2020). Appendix B.8 shows
additional experiments at higher temperatures.
Additional task: multiple-choice. Models are
also tested on a multiple-choice variation of the
main task. This uses the same questions as the
generation task. The choices for each question are
the sets of true and false reference answers. To
evaluate a model on a question, we compute the
likelihood of each reference answer independently,
2TruthfulQA was not designed for use as a few-shot benchmark. We suspect that few-shot performance would overstate
the truthfulness of a model on real-world tasks.

conditional on the default prompt and question.
The truthfulness score for the question is the total
normalized likelihood of the true answers (normalized across all true and false reference answers).
Evaluating language generation. For all results reported on the main task (generation), we
use human evaluation to score models on truthfulness and informativeness, where a model’s score is
the percentage of its responses that a human judges
to be true or informative. The authors carried out
all evaluations using the procedure described in
Appendix D, which was designed to make evaluations replicable and consistent across evaluators.
Since human evaluation is costly, we also test how
well automated metrics serve as a proxy. We introduce a new metric for this purpose, which we call
“GPT-judge”. GPT-judge is a GPT-3-6.7B model
finetuned to classify answers to the questions in
TruthfulQA as true or false. A similar model was
finetuned to evaluate informativeness (rather than
truthfulness). The details of the finetuning procedure are provided in Appendix B.1, along with comparisons to other commonly used automated metrics for natural language generation. Comparisons
between GPT-judge and human evaluations are discussed in Section 4.4. The training set for GPTjudge consists of triples of the form (question,
answer, label), where label is either true
or false. The training set includes 6.9k examples
where the answer is a true/false reference answer
written by the authors. We also have around 15.5k
examples where the answer is generated by one of
the models in Section 3.1 and the label is a human
evaluation.
4 Results
4.1 Truthfulness of models vs humans
The human participant produced 94% true answers
(Fig. 4). 87% of their answers were both true and
informative. Across all model sizes and prompts,
the best model (GPT-3-175B with helpful prompt)
produced 58% true answers and 21% true and informative answers. This model gave false and informative answers 42% of the time (compared to 6% for
the human participant). Different prompts for GPT3-175B had a significant impact on truthfulness
but not on the percentage of true and informative
answers (Appendix B.6).
Figure 13 shows results broken down by category of question. The best model was less truthful
than the human on almost all categories. We sus-

pect that answers from certain categories (e.g. law
or health) are more likely to deceive humans than
for other categories (e.g. proverbs or “myths and
fairytales”). If we restrict to all categories with
non-trivial risk of deception (Fig. 14), model performance is still poor.
4.2 Larger models are less truthful
Figure 2 shows that larger models generally do
worse than smaller models in the same family (inverse scaling). For example, the largest GPT-Neo/J
is 17% less truthful than a model 60x smaller. The
UnifiedQA models generally do better on truthfulness than the three GPT families, but these models
are also the least informative — probably because
they are fine-tuned for QA tasks with a different
format and objective (Khashabi et al., 2020).
While larger models were less truthful, they were
more informative. This suggests that scaling up
model size makes models more capable (in principle) of being both truthful and informative.
For the multiple-choice task (where models
choose answers rather than generating them), the
larger models also perform worse than smaller ones
(Fig. 4c). For example, GPT-Neo/J 6B was 12%
less truthful than GPT-Neo/J 125M. No models
significantly outperformed random guessing. The
concordance between the generation task and the
multiple-choice task suggests that the tendency of
larger models to perform worse is not an artifact
of human evaluation or of the hyperparameters we
used for generating answers.
Results for both the generation and multiplechoice tasks on more recent models can be found
in Appendix B.3.
4.3 Interpretation of results
If a model returns a false answer to a question in
our benchmark, this could be because the answer
is an imitative falsehood. However, it could also
be caused by the syntax or style of the question.
These are “non-imitative” falsehoods, as they are
not incentivized by the model’s training objective.
We define a “weakness” to be a property of a model
that causes it to perform poorly at a task (i.e., to produce falsehoods). Then imitative and non-imitative
falsehoods are produced as a result of imitative and
non-imitative weaknesses in a model, respectively.
Given how we constructed questions (Section 2.2), it is probable that some of our questions
exploit non-imitative weaknesses, which may be

Figure 4: Truthfulness and informativeness for gene
results for generating full-sentence answers against a h
relevant to the question – as contrasted with true and
choice, models are mostly below chance and larger mo
for GPT-3-175B, while other models/sizes use the defa
fixed by scaling up models. Yet we believe imitative falsehoods make up a substantial portion of the
false model responses to our questions. This belief
is based on convergent lines of evidence:
Consistency. The GPT-Neo/J family of models show a similar inverse scaling trend to GPT-3
(Fig. 2). Yet we did not do adversarial filtering with
GPT-Neo/J. If an answer is an imitative falsehood
for GPT-3, it would likely transfer to GPT-J, as the
training distribution and performance of the models
is similar. It is less likely (though not impossible)
that a non-imitative falsehood caused by specific
syntax or grammatical artifacts would transfer.
Controls. We ran an experiment testing models
on matched control questions. Each question was
constructed by editing 1-3 words of a question in
TruthfulQA (see Appendix C.2 for examples). The
edits preserve the form of the questions but turn
them into straightforward trivia or common-sense
questions. If TruthfulQA questions exploit nonimitative weaknesses, we would expect many of
the matched controls to exploit similar weaknesses.

ion and multiple-choice tasks. Plots (a) and (b) show
an baseline. An answer is informative if it is potentially
nformative answers like “No comment”. For multiples do worse. (NB: “Help” and “Harm” are two prompts
QA prompt.)
Yet Figure 2 shows that truthfulness on the matched
controls improves with model size for all model
families and that the largest GPT-3 and GPT-Neo/J
achieve high absolute truthfulness scores.
Paraphrases. We ran an experiment testing
models on paraphrases of the TruthfulQA questions. If a question causes an imitative falsehood,
the paraphrase should cause the same falsehood.
Overall, we find that truthfulness scores for models do not change substantially on the paraphrased
questions (Appendix B.9). In particular, the largest
GPT-3 and GPT-Neo/J models still perform worse
than the smaller models in the family.
This evidence suggests that the poor performance of models on TruthfulQA is not explained
by most questions exploiting a (non-imitative)
weakness to a particular syntax or form. It is
harder to rule out non-imitative weaknesses that
are more “semantic” in nature. Future work could
test whether more diverse or larger models produce
the same kind of falsehoods on TruthfulQA.
Given these results, how would scaling up model

size affect truthfulness? It seems unlikely that
scaling up GPT-3 or GPT-J by 5x would dramatically improve scores on TruthfulQA. If the benchmark contains a subset of questions that target nonimitative weaknesses (Section 4.2), performance
on this subset could improve with model size, but
we would expect the effect to be small. Instead,
we believe that scaling up is most promising in
conjunction with other techniques such as prompt
engineering or finetuning. We found that prompts
instructing GPT-3 to be truthful led to improved
performance, and we would expect that this effect
would be more pronounced for larger models. Related work on language models suggests that finetuning would have similar benefits. Models could
be fine-tuned on a set of examples chosen to demonstrate truthfulness (Solaiman and Dennison, 2021)
or fine-tuned by reinforcement learning from human feedback (Stiennon et al., 2020). These techniques could be combined with information retrieval, provided that models can avoid retrieving
from unreliable sources (Lewis et al., 2020).
4.4 Automated metrics vs human evaluation
The finetuned GPT-judge model is able to predict
human evaluations of truthfulness with 90-96% validation accuracy. GPT-judge also generalizes well
to new answer formats. In particular, UnifiedQA
models differ in architecture and pre-training from
the GPT models and generate answers very different in form and content. Yet GPT-judge still
achieves 90% validation accuracy on UnifiedQA
when finetuned only on answers from the GPT families. We also validated GPT-judge on our human
baseline. No human baselines were included in
GPT-judge’s training set, and the models included
were significantly less truthful than the human. Predictive accuracy on the human baseline was 89.5%.
We have shown that GPT-judge is reasonably
robust and provides a cheap alternative to human
evaluation. GPT-judge could likely be further improved by adding more training data and by using
a larger pre-trained GPT-3 model. Full results are
given in Appendix B.1, where Table 1 includes additional comparisons to standard natural language
generation metrics. A GPT-3 model finetuned to
predict informativeness also achieves a promising
86.3% on UnifiedQA (Table 2).

5 Discussion
The questions in TruthfulQA are designed such
that correct answers are not incentivized by the
standard LM objective. The poor performance of
the baseline models is therefore not surprising, as
these models are trained to predict human text and
do not directly learn to be truthful. In particular,
models are likely to repeat false claims that are often stated by humans. We believe that TruthfulQA
tests for many such claims.
While we don’t expect current models to be truthful, there are many contexts in which truthfulness is
necessary. Large language models such as GPT-3
may see widespread use as foundation models for
downstream tasks that require robust truthfulness
(Bommasani et al., 2021). We believe that TruthfulQA is valuable in providing a way to test the
behavior of models that are expected to be truthful,
even when the foundation model is misaligned.
6 Related Work
Numerous NLP benchmarks test models on factual questions (Bhakthavatsalam et al., 2021; Clark
et al., 2018; Hendrycks et al., 2020; Talmor et al.,
2019). If an answer is correct, then it is also
truthful — but our concept of truthfulness also allows non-committal responses (Section 2.1). While
most benchmarks are multiple choice, some require
models to generate short (single-phrase) answers
(Hendrycks et al., 2021; Lewis et al., 2020).
Concepts related to truthfulness in natural language generation include factuality, veracity, and
avoiding hallucinations (Shuster et al., 2021; Zhou
et al., 2021). Evans et al. (2021) refine the concept of truthfulness and draw distinctions between
truthfulness and honesty. Truthfulness is relevant
to many applications including generating news
stories (Kreps et al., 2020; Zellers et al., 2019),
summarization (Gabriel et al., 2021; Maynez et al.,
2020; Stiennon et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020),
conversational dialog (Shuster et al., 2021; Roller
et al., 2021), and question answering (Dou et al.,
2021; Krishna et al., 2021; Lewis et al., 2020; Logan IV et al., 2019). A related line of research is
automated fact-checking (Thorne et al., 2018; Aly
et al., 2021; Baly et al., 2018), where the focus is
on evaluation of statements rather than generation.
The problem of imitative falsehoods is similar to
models learning to imitate offensive or prejudiced
language (Kenton et al., 2021; Bender et al., 2021).
An offensive statement may have higher probabil-

ity on the training distribution than a non-offensive
alternative. This is an example of mis-alignment
between the model’s training objective (e.g. to imitate text on the web) and the goals and values of
human users (e.g. to avoid offensive language or to
avoid falsehoods). Another example is when GPT3 models trained on GitHub learn to produce buggy
code (Chen et al., 2021). Increasing the safety and
alignment of pre-trained models remains a challenging problem (Dinan et al., 2020; Tamkin et al.,
2021; Xu et al., 2020; Solaiman and Dennison,
2021; McGuffie and Newhouse, 2020).
7 Conclusion
Making models more truthful is a major challenge
for AI. Truthful models could contribute to areas
like medicine, law, science, and engineering. Conversely, non-truthful models could cause deception
and distrust at scale. To develop truthful models,
we need a set of benchmarks and tools to measure
truthfulness. TruthfulQA focuses on measuring
imitative falsehoods, which are failures of truthfulness unlikely to be solved by scaling up models.
We find that today’s large models are much less
truthful than humans in the zero-shot setting.
Strong performance on TruthfulQA does not imply that a model will be truthful in a specialized domain. But poor performance does indicate a lack of
robustness. Moreover, failures on TruthfulQA are
relatively interpretable by ML researchers because
our questions do not require any specialized knowledge (and all questions are supported by sources).
Thus TruthfulQA may be a useful benchmark for
both general-purpose and specialized models.
8 Ethics and Impact
TruthfulQA tests models on general-knowledge
questions designed to elicit imitative falsehoods.
If a model performs well, we cannot conclude that
it will be equally truthful on other kinds of tasks
(even if we expect some transfer). For instance,
TruthfulQA does not cover long-form generation
(e.g. news articles) or interactive settings (e.g. extended chat with an adversarial human). Moreover,
while the questions in TruthfulQA resemble realworld questions, they were not collected from a
deployed system — and hence may over- or underestimate truthfulness for a deployed system.
An objective that rewards truthfulness can be
flipped to reward falsehood. Could someone create
a deceptive model using TruthfulQA? We claim

that TruthfulQA is unlikely to be useful for people
trying to construct deceptive models for malicious
purposes. In order to be deceptive, a model needs
to produce false answers relatively infrequently –
otherwise humans will quickly realize that it cannot be trusted. Yet to get a low score on TruthfulQA, models need to answer almost all questions
falsely. In order to be useful for malicious purposes, a model needs to produce false statements
that are extremely specific (e.g. statements about a
victim who is targeted by the malicious human, or
statements about a particular government policy).
Yet TruthfulQA does not cover any topics with extreme specificity but instead has shallow coverage
of general-knowledge topics.

B Additional results
B.1 Automated metrics vs human evaluation
Since human evaluation is costly and challenging
to replicate, we introduce a new automated metric for evaluating model performance on TruthfulQA, which we call “GPT-judge”. GPT-judge is
a GPT-3-6.7B model finetuned to classify answers
to the questions in TruthfulQA as true or false.
The training set for GPT-judge consists of triples
of the form (question, answer, label),
where label is either true or false. The training
set includes 6.9k examples taken directly from the
benchmark, where the answer is a true/false reference answer written by the authors. It also contains
around 15.5k examples where the answer is generated by one of the models in Section 3.1 and the
label is a human evaluation.
For the final GPT-judge model, we train on examples from all models. The goal of GPT-judge is
to evaluate truth for the questions in TruthfulQA
only (with no need to generalize to new questions)
and so we always include all questions in the training set. We use the OpenAI API to perform the
finetuning (OpenAI, 2020). We also use an identical approach to finetune a model to evaluate informativeness (rather than truthfulness).
Separately, to estimate GPT-judge’s ability to
generalize to a new model family F , we fine-tune
a GPT-judge model on all other model families and
use F as a validation set. These validation accuracies are shown in Table 1 below, which includes
additional comparisons of GPT-judge to alternate
metrics that make use of ROUGE1 (Lin, 2004)
or BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020). To compute a
truthfulness score for a model answer a, these metrics find the closest true and false reference answers
to a and then take the arithmetic difference between
match scores. Overlap or semantic similarity between a and each reference answer is measured
using ROUGE1 or BLEURT, respectively. GPTjudge performs well in an absolute sense, demonstrating high validation accuracy across all four
model families and preserving the rank ordering of
models within each family. It also outperforms all
alternate metrics in evaluating model answers. We
believe that GPT-judge is a reasonable proxy for
human evaluation, although the minor weakness
shown in Table 3 suggests that human evaluation
should still be considered the gold standard.

Figure 9: Calibration of the GPT-judge automated metric. The plot shows accuracy as a function of confidence
for GPT-judge on the GPT-3 validation set. GPT-judge is given a question and model answer, and asked to evaluate
whether the answer is true. The score is the probability that GPT-judge assigns to the token ‘ yes’. NB: In the plot,
the leftmost ‘0%’ bin contains the set of examples for which the token ‘ yes’ does not appear in the set of most
likely token completions. This corresponds to a metric score of 0 and makes up around 40% of the total examples.
All other nonzero scores are mapped to the appropriate percentiles.

Ness Monster. I’m kidding. The
largest animal that lives in the Loch
Ness is the Atlantic Salmon.
Human: Earth’s gravitational field
extends into space, and therefore
pulls the ISS and astronauts inside
it. However, things in the ISS are at
a trajectory that cancels out the effect of gravity and thus experience a
state of weightlessness.
Human: In the fictional Hans Christian Andersen tale, the ugly duckling grows up to become a beautiful
swan.
Chat: Well, it depends on the size of

Table 4: Complete results for all models and sizes. This table shows scores for scalar truth, binarized truth,
binarized truth via the automated metric GPT-judge, and scores combining truthfulness and informativeness.
• “Truth score” is the average over scalar truth scores (Section 2.2).
• “Truth*Info score” is the average over the product of scalar truth and informativeness scores.
• “% True” is the percentage of answers that are true when thresholding scalar scores at 0.5.
• “% Info” is the percentage of answers that are informative when thresholding scalar scores at 0.5.
• “% True+Info” is the percentage of answers that are true and informative when thresholding scalar scores at
0.5.
• “% True (GPT-judge)” is the percentage of answers that are true according the automated metric GPT-judge
(Section 3.2).
• “Truth score unf.” is the average truth score restricted to the unfiltered questions (while all other columns are
for all questions in TruthfulQA). See Section 2.2.

B.3 Results on newer language models
Since the benchmark was initially published, several new language models have been released and
evaluated on the two TruthfulQA tasks by external
researchers:
1. Anthropic’s model uses context distillation to
incorporate a prompt into the model’s parameters. The prompt is designed to encourage
answers that are “helpful, honest, and harmless” (Askell et al., 2021).
2. InstructGPT is a GPT-3 based model that is
finetuned with human preferences to follow
natural language instructions (Ouyang et al.,
2021).
3. WebGPT is a GPT-3 based model that is
given access to a text-based web browser and
search engine that it can use to answer questions (Nakano et al., 2021).
4. Gopher is a 280-billion parameter model
whose pre-training data was more heavily filtered for high-quality, scientific sources (Rae
et al., 2021).
The mechanisms introduced in these models lead
to performance gains on the TruthfulQA generation task (Figure 10), as well as a return to a positive scaling trend for the largest model sizes (Figure 11). However, there is still a large gap between
the best-performing model (WebGPT) and the human baseline, especially when both truthfulness
and informativeness are taken into account. While
information retrieval, prompt engineering, and finetuning appear to be more efficient in improving
performance on TruthfulQA than simply scaling
up model size, the benchmark remains a challenge
for current state-of-the-art language models.

Figure 11: Scaling trends on the multiple-choice task. We are primarily interested in using the generation task
to measure how often large language models produce false statements. Unfortunately, natural language generation
is costly to evaluate. External groups provided more detailed results across a range of model sizes using the
multiple-choice task instead, which can be evaluated cheaply in an automated fashion.
At large model sizes, the Anthropic3, Gopher, and InstructGPT models exhibit a return to positive scaling. However, the rate of improvement with respect to parameter count is very slow. Using simple linear extrapolation,
an InstructGPT model with 1020 parameters would only score 48%, compared to a human baseline of 95%. (We
expect that in practice, performance will improve more quickly than the naive extrapolation suggests, but it is
difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding scaling trends with three data points per model.)
3Without context distillation, Anthropic’s model replicates the inverse scaling trend seen in our original GPT-3 baseline.

Section 2.2, TruthfulQA contains 437 questions that were adversarially filtered with GPT-3-175B (QA prompt) as
the target model and an additional 380 unfiltered questions. These graphs show the same models as in Figure 2
but evaluated on the filtered and unfiltered questions separately (rather than combining all questions). There are

our categories into “practical” and “non-practical”. The latter are ‘Fiction’, ‘Proverbs’, ‘Myths and Fairytales’
and ‘Subjective’. Answers to non-practical questions are very unlikely to fool humans, as they involve things like
confusing fact and fiction. The models tested are the same as in Figure 2 from the main text.

Figure 19: Truthfulness of GPT-3 with different temperatures. Higher temperatures are often used for generating longer and more human-like outputs. Using various model sizes and prompts with GPT-judge as the metric, we
generate text with temperature set to 1. “Best of 20” generates 20 samples and selects the argmax of the per-token
log-probability, while “Sample” takes a single sample. Results show the same trend of worse performance at larger
model sizes, suggesting that higher temperatures are not substantially changing performance trends.

C Dataset construction
C.1 Reference answers
Reference answers for each question in TruthfulQA
are constructed as follows:
We take a set of true answers directly from
Wikipedia (or the listed source). We then try to
provide coverage of common variations on this answer. For example, given the question “Where is
Walt Disney’s body?”, we include the following
true reference answers: “Walt Disney’s body was
cremated after his death”; “Walt Disney’s body was
interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park”; “Walt
Disney’s body was interred in Glendale, California”; “Walt Disney’s body was interred in the U.S.”
Many of these answers have a similar meaning but
different levels of specificity.
We follow a similar process for generating false
answers, but widen the answer set by running internet searches for [common misconceptions / superstitions / conspiracies around X] where relevant, as there tend to be many possible imitative
false answers that are not always covered in a single source. For the question above, these additional searches unearthed theories claiming that
Walt Disney’s body is frozen, in suspended animation, buried under Disneyland, or buried under a
Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. Some but
not all of these are covered on Wikipedia.
While we aim for decent coverage of true and
imitative false answers, we are unable to cover all
possible true / false statements that models generate in response to these questions, particularly
for smaller models that tend to produce irrelevant
answers. We think this will be less of a problem
as models continue to grow in size and capability,
as we find that larger models tend to be more informative (indicating that they are more likely to
answer the question directly).

D Human evaluations
We designed an evaluation procedure aimed at
making evaluation objective and reproducible. The
main features of the procedure are:
1. The evaluators are blinded to the model name
and prompt that generated an answer.
2. Instead of evaluators assigning a truth value
or score to answers directly, they assign one
of 13 qualitative labels to an answer (see Table 8). These labels include “mostly true”,
“mixed true/false”, and “contradiction”. Each
label maps to a truth score (e.g. “mostly true”
maps to 0.9) and this mapping was fixed before evaluating any answers. This procedure
makes the assigning of truth scores more interpretable and consistent across evaluators.
3. Scalar truth scores are thresholded at 0.5 for a
binary true / false split, where ≥ 0.5 is considered truthful. This discards some granularity
but helps with consistency. For example, we
might expect that evaluators will sometimes
differ in judging questions to be in one of the
following three categories: [True, Mostly true,
Qualified truth]. However, these sets of categories are mapped to the same binary label, so
differences of this form do not matter in the
final evaluation.
4. Answers were verified by consulting a reliable source where appropriate. For around
80% of the answers that were evaluated, there
was a close semantic match to one of our reference answers (which already has a source
supporting it). Around 19% of answers were
tautologies, contradictions or nonsense and so
there is no source that is appropriate. For the
remaining answers, evaluators searched for
sources from sites like Our World in Data and
Wikipedia.
5. A similar process is used to evaluate informativeness, with labels and examples shown in
Table 9.

My answer:

F Checking for data quality and instructions would disagree with our evaluations on
disagreement 2-6% of questions. Given our choice of including
informal and somewhat ambiguous questions (of
TruthfulQA consists of questions and sets of true
the kind that appear frequently in everyday converand false reference answers to the questions. In
sation), we think that achieving very low levels of
labeling reference answers as true or false, it is
disagreement in evaluation (e.g. below 0.5%) may
possible that we made a small number of errors. It
not be feasible.
is likely also that people will disagree with some

We would like to estimate the percentage of
evaluation rather than genuinely different propensiquestions on which people disagree with our evalties for truthfulness. (Current differences in scores
uations. We collected two complementary kinds of
between baseline models are much too large for
data:
this worry to apply.)
1. We recruited a “validator” to check our reference answers and raise disagreements. The
validator was given written instructions for
TruthfulQA but no feedback during the task.
Their task was to decide which of a pair of reference answers to label as true for 100 questions, with both questions and answers sampled randomly. The validator was asked to
describe disagreements or ambiguities. Overall, the validator chose different labels than us
on 7% of questions. We suspect 3-4% of these
indicate implicit disagreements and the rest
result from mistakes by the validator. (The
validator spent less than 2 minutes per question and so mistakes were likely). The validator explicitly described a disagreement or
ambiguity on 6% of instances. Of these, 3%
pointed to a disagreement about the question
itself and 3% concerned particular reference
answers.
2. We recruited a “participant” to act as a human baseline for TruthfulQA (as reported in
the main text). The participant answered 250
randomly sampled questions. Unlike the validator, they did not see any reference answers.
Overall, 6% of their answers were marked as
false according to our evaluation. Of these,
we suspect 2% represent disagreement with
our evaluation and rest were mistakes by the
participant. (The participant spent less than
2 minutes per question and so mistakes were
likely).
Based on this data, we modified 43 of our questions (5.3% of the total) to make them less ambiguous. Ignoring this improvement, we can form
a (rough) point estimate that people who read the
