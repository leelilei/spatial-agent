## Extracted Abstract

We study whether language models can evaluate the validity of their own claims and predict which questions they will be able to answer correctly. We first show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice and true/false questions when they are provided in the right format. Thus we can approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks by asking models to first propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability "P(True)" that their answers are correct. We find encouraging performance, calibration, and scaling for P(True) on a diverse array of tasks. Performance at self-evaluation further improves when we allow models to consider many of their own samples before predicting the validity of one specific possibility. Next, we investigate whether models can be trained to predict "P(IK)", the probability that "I know" the answer to a question, without reference to any particular proposed answer. Models perform well at predicting P(IK) and partially generalize across tasks, though they struggle with calibration of P(IK) on new tasks. The predicted P(IK) probabilities also increase appropriately in the presence of relevant source materials in the context, and in the presence of hints towards the solution of mathematical word problems.

Abstract
We study whether language models can evaluate the validity of their own claims and predict
which questions they will be able to answer correctly. We first show that larger models are
well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice and true/false questions when they are provided
in the right format. Thus we can approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks
by asking models to first propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability "P(True)"
that their answers are correct. We find encouraging performance, calibration, and scaling
for P(True) on a diverse array of tasks. Performance at self-evaluation further improves
when we allow models to consider many of their own samples before predicting the validity of one specific possibility. Next, we investigate whether models can be trained to
predict "P(IK)", the probability that "I know" the answer to a question, without reference
to any particular proposed answer. Models perform well at predicting P(IK) and partially
generalize across tasks, though they struggle with calibration of P(IK) on new tasks. The
predicted P(IK) probabilities also increase appropriately in the presence of relevant source
materials in the context, and in the presence of hints towards the solution of mathematical
word problems. We hope these observations lay the groundwork for training more honest
models, and for investigating how honesty generalizes to cases where models are trained
on objectives other than the imitation of human writing.

Figure 1 (left) We show the overall ability of a 52B language model to evaluate its own proposed answers
(sampled at unit temperature) to questions from TriviaQA, Lambada, Arithmetic, GSM8k, and Codex HumanEval. We have weighted the overall contribution from each of these five datasets equally. We evaluate
20-shot using the method of section 4, where we show the model several of its own samples and then ask for
the probability P(True) that a specific sample is correct. (right) We show the improvement in the accuracy
on each sampling task when only including questions where a randomly sampled (unit temperature) response
achieved P(True) > 0.5.
1 Introduction
We would eventually like to train AI systems that are honest, which requires that these systems accurately
and faithfully evaluate their level of confidence in their own knowledge and reasoning. So AI systems must
be able to recognize what they do and do not know, as a prerequisite. In this work, we study the extent to
which Language Models (LMs) possess this ability and how it can be elicited and imparted.
As a starting point, we examine calibration: do the probabilistic predictions from language models match
up with frequencies of occurrence? Language models can produce well-calibrated predictions for token
probabilities on-distribution [Guo et al., 2017]. We show that large language models are also well-calibrated
on a diverse array of multiple choice questions, as long as the questions are formatted appropriately. In
particular, calibration improves with model size and few-shot prompting.
Good calibration opens up the possibility for using models to evaluate the accuracy of their own outputs
(“self-evaluation”). For example, given any open-ended query, we can sample an answer from the model
and then have the model evaluate P(True), the probability that its answer is correct. We may expect selfevaluation to be challenging, because the model may be overconfident that its own samples1 are correct. Our
self-evaluation procedure nevertheless distinguishes correct and incorrect samples, as summarized in Figure
1. Furthermore, as model size and capabilities increase, models improve at self-evaluation, which suggests
that verification improves faster than generation quality in this context.
We also show that self-evaluation can be improved if we provide a model with many of its own samples,
before asking it to evaluate any single sample. That is, ‘brainstorming other possibilities’ helps large models
to evaluate the validity of a given answer option.
These techniques address a question about the world, as they ask models to evaluate “according to accepted
truth in the wider world (i.e. according to humans), is a particular answer to a question correct?” In the case
of self-evaluation, the proposed answer was provided by the model, but its validity is nevertheless an external
fact.
But we are also interested in having language models attempt to directly evaluate their own state of knowledge. To this purpose, we investigate what happens when we train models to predict whether or not they can
correctly answer questions themselves. This is really a question about the model2 since we are training the
model to learn what sorts of questions it, in particular, can answer.
1Another more subtle issue is that in our setup, models have no way to distinguish the tokens they’ve written from
tokens they were given by a third party.
2This claim is subtle, since the model could be learning “how hard is this question in general?” rather than “do I know
the answer to this?” We partially address this concern in section 5.5.

Figure 2 Left: We train a P(IK) classifier to predict whether or not a model knows the answer to TriviaQA
questions, and then evaluate on Arithmetic, Python Function Synthesis, and Lambada questions. This histogram shows P(IK) scores exclusively from OOD questions. Right: We train a P(IK) classifier on TriviaQA,
Arithmetic, Python Function Synthesis, and Lambada and histogram P(IK) scores for their test sets.
We find that language models can easily learn to perform well at evaluating P(IK), the probability that they
know the answer to a question, on a given distribution (see Figure 3 for an illustration). More intriguingly,
we also find some generalization across tasks, for example from trivia to story completion, math, and code,
though models struggle with calibration OOD. We also observe some other types of generalization: although
P(IK) was only trained on bare questions, it generalizes in such a way that it increases when we provide
source materials that address these questions (for trivia) and when we provide hints for math word problems.
1.1 Contributions
Calibration: Multiple Choice, None of the Above, and True/False
• We show that when we use a format with visible lettered answer options, large models are very
well calibrated on diverse multiple choice questions (e.g. from BIG Bench [Srivastava et al., 2022],
MMLU [Hendrycks et al., 2021], and many other evaluations); see Figures 4, 5, and 6.
• Calibration improves with model size, and it also improves when we pass from zero-shot to few-shot
evaluation; see Figure 4.
• Replacing an option with ‘none of the above’ reduces accuracy and calibration significantly with our
models (see Figure 7). However, our models are also well calibrated on True/False distinctions (see
Figure 8), with accuracy and calibration also increasing with model capability.
• We also show that RLHF policies [Bai et al., 2022] naively seem miscalibrated, but with a simple
temperature adjustment they become fairly well-calibrated on several evaluations (Figure 9).
Self-Evaluation of Model-Generated Samples, without Finetuning
We evaluate on the generative tasks TriviaQA [Joshi et al., 2017], Lambada [Paperno et al., 2016], GSM8k
[Cobbe et al., 2021], the Codex HumanEval [Chen et al., 2021], arithmetic problems, and natural function
synthesis problems scraped from GitHub. See Figure 1 for a brief overview of results.
• Models can self-evaluate whether their own samples are True or False, though this tends to be a more
challenging task (since models tend to find their own samples more plausible). Self-evaluations are
well-calibrated few-shot, though models aren’t as well-calibrated zero-shot. In particular, larger k
for k-shot self-evaluation seems to primarily help by improving calibration, rather than by improving
the AUROC for separating correct and incorrect responses. See Figures 10 and 11 in the main text
for representative results, and Figures 28, 29, and 30 in the appendix for complete results.
• Showing models many of their own T = 1 samples, along with a single sample to evaluate as True/-
False, can significantly improve their performance (this is somewhat reminiscent of self-consistency
prompting [Wang et al., 2022]).
We conclude that language models can perform well at this task few-shot, with most measures of performance
improving with model size, even though models are being asked to evaluate their own samples.

Finetuning to Identify the Questions Models Can Correctly Answer
We are also interested in whether models know, or can be taught, to specifically identify questions that they
can and cannot answer, rather than simply evaluating whether answers to questions are in fact correct. Figure
2 provides a brief overview of results.
• We train models with a value head to predict the probability that they can answer a question correctly, which we refer to as P(IK). We find that models trained on TriviaQA have significant power to
differentiate between math, lambada, and code questions that they can answer; see Figure 12. However, P(IK) tends to be poorly calibrated on these other distributions (see Figure 13). Generalization
is perhaps most clearly illustrated in Figures 16 and 17.
• We study generalization of P(IK) to the inclusion of source materials and mathematical hints, see
Figures 18 and 19. We find that P(IK) responds appropriately to sources, correct hints, and incorrect
or distracting hints.
• We compare two models with roughly equal capability, but different pretraining data, in Figure 20.
These models are somewhat better at predicting their own P(IK) rather than that for another model.
We also try "crossing" the P(IK) training data for these models, and find a small effect suggesting
that models generalize better when trained on what they know, rather than on what the other model
knew.
Thus we conclude that we only find partial generalization on this task.
Glossary: Observables and Metrics
• P(True) – The probability a model assigns to the proposition that a specific sample is the correct
answer to a question.
• P(IK) – The probability a model assigns to "I know", i.e. the proposition that it will answer a given
question correctly when samples are generated at unit temperature. In this work, P(IK) is usually
computed using a binary classification head on top of a language model.
• Ground Truth P(IK) – The fraction of unit temperature samples to a question that are correct.
• Calibration Charts - We often plot prediction probability vs frequency that a prediction was correct,
see Figure 4 as an example. We use all predictions (not just predictions for the correct answer) and
put the same number of predictions in each bin (rather than using equally spaced bins).
• Expected or RMS Calibration Error - To obtain a single number summarizing calibration, we
compute the ECE as the mean of the absolute difference between probabilistic predictions and frequencies. For ECE we always use 10 bins, with an equal number of predictions in each. What we
call the ECE has also been called the mean absolute deviation calibration error [Lin et al., 2022]. To
more closely match other works, we only use the most likely predictions (for multiple choice) when
computing the ECE, instead of using all predictions. We also include the RMS calibration error,
which is better motivated theoretically, but seems to be less widely used in the literature.
• AUROC - We sometimes share the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) discriminating between questions models do or do not know the answer to, or discriminating between
samples a model does or does not identify as correct. This captures discriminative power but is
indifferent to calibration (note chance AUROC is 0.5, and larger scores are better).
• (Conditional) Accuracy - When models self-evaluate the probability P(True) that their own samples
are valid, we are very interested in the accuracy of the samples that models label as ‘True’ (i.e.
correct), and how this compares to the accuracy on the full distribution of problems in the task.
• Brier Score - In some cases we observe tradeoffs between discrimination (e.g. best AUROC) and
calibration. Brier scores combine the discriminative power of self-evaluation with calibration (note
the chance Brier score on binary choice tasks is 0.25, and smaller scores are better).
1.2 Models and Evaluation Tasks
Our goal in this study is to evaluate calibration and generalization on a diverse range of tasks. As
such we include all of the multiple choice evaluations in BIG Bench [Srivastava et al., 2022], the MMLU
5

Figure 3 Examples of P(IK) scores from a 52B model. Token sequences that ask harder questions have
lower P(IK) scores on the last token. To evaluate P(IK) on a specific full sequence, we simply take the P(IK)
score at the last token. Note that we only train P(IK) on final tokens (and not on partial questions).
evaluation [Hendrycks et al., 2021], TruthfulQA [Lin et al., 2021], LogiQA [Liu et al., 2020], and QuALITY [Pang et al., 2021]. We are most interested in open-ended generation, so we study the samplingbased evaluations TriviaQA [Joshi et al., 2017], Lambada [Paperno et al., 2016], the Codex HumanEval
[Chen et al., 2021], GSM8k [Cobbe et al., 2021], some basic arithmetic problems, and a dataset of additional
web-scraped Python function synthesis problems. See Appendix D for more information on our arithmetic
and function synthesis datasets. Ultimately, we would like to train models to express calibrated confidence
levels when generating long-form responses in natural language dialogue.
When we perform few-shot evaluation, we simply stuff the context with randomly chosen examples from
the (test) evaluation itself. For BIG Bench this means all few-shot examples come from within the specific
subtask we are evaluating, though in the case of MMLU we randomize across the entire evaluation, without
respecting subject boundaries.
We study a series of language models with 800M, 3B, 12B, 52B parameters. We do not include smaller
models because they perform poorly on many of the evaluations we consider. The architecture and training
setup for these models is identical to that in [Bai et al., 2022], except that the models we consider here were
pretrained for 850B tokens, rather than the 400B tokens used in that work. For simplicity, we do not study
models that have been finetuned on python code, though our pretraining distribution includes about 10%
code. In section 3.3 we briefly study helpful and harmless RLHF policies finetuned (via the process in
[Bai et al., 2022]) from these language models, but otherwise we only study pure language models. We show
accuracies for our models on a few of the multiple choice tasks we study in Figure 37 in the appendix.
1.3 Related Work
Calibration for general ML predictions, and interventions to improve calibration, have been studied [Nguyen and O’Connor, 2015, Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016, Nalisnick et al., 2019, Guo et al., 2017,
Hendrycks et al., 2018, Ovadia et al., 2019, Minderer et al., 2021] for some time. Calibration for language
models and QA has also been studied [Desai and Durrett, 2020, Jiang et al., 2021], but typically it has been
found that to achieve good calibration predictions must be adjusted. Selective prediction, where models abstain from answering certain questions, has been studied as well [Varshney et al., 2022]. Recently, the calibration of a wide range of models was analyzed on the diverse BIG Bench suite of tasks [Srivastava et al., 2022],
where it was shown that language model calibration improves with model size. We are indebted to the
BIG Bench collaboration for providing a convenient, huge, and diverse evaluation set. The authors of Gopher
[Rae et al., 2021] briefly studied calibration on MMLU [Hendrycks et al., 2021] and found promising results,
which led us to experiment with a variety of multiple choice formats.

Figure 4 (left) We show calibration curves for various model sizes on all of the multiple choice tasks in
BIG Bench, in the format described in section 2. We include a dashed line indicating perfect calibration.
(right) Here we show trends in the expected calibration error on BIG Bench, for both multiple choice and a
separate True/False format (see Section 3.2). We show the RMS calibration error in Figure 21 in the appendix.
Truthfulness [Evans et al., 2021] has been a recent focus of various works, including benchmarks
[Lin et al., 2021] and the incorporation of web search and citation [Nakano et al., 2021, Menick et al., 2022]
into language models. That said, truthfulness focuses primarily on factual accuracy "in the world",
rather than on self-knowledge, or eliciting latent knowledge [Christiano et al., 2021]. We use "honesty"
[Askell et al., 2021] as an umbrella term for ideas including truthfulness, calibration, self-knowledge,
explainability, and non-deceptiveness. Language models finetuned to perform non-language tasks
[Ahn et al., 2022, Dinh et al., 2022] might provide an interesting test-bed for honesty in the future.
Perhaps the work most similar to ours is [Mielke et al., 2020], which is a very interesting application of
metacognition/self-evaluation to improve natural language calibration. Another quite similar work is the very
recent [Lin et al., 2022], where the authors train language models to express their calibration on arithmetic in
words, and also study a signal analogous to P(True).
2 Larger Models are Calibrated on Diverse Multiple Choice Questions
A model makes calibrated predictions if the probability it assigns to outcomes coincides with the frequency
with which these outcomes actually occur. Language models are known to produce calibrated token-level
probabilities. In this section we will see that language models can produce well-calibrated probabilities when
they are asked to choose the correct answer from among several explicit options. We believe calibration
is interesting on its own, but it is especially relevant to honesty, since a model that can produce calibrated
answers to meta-questions like ‘do you know the answer to X?’ must know something about what it knows.
Generally we can use calibration as a way to bootstrap towards self-knowledge.
We find that when multiple choice problems are formatted in this way (as used by e.g. [Rae et al., 2021]):
Question: Who was the first president of the United States?
Choices:
(A) Barack Obama
(B) George Washington
(C) Michael Jackson
Answer:
and we identify the answers only by their labels, as e.g. ‘ (B)’, our largest models tend to produce a wellcalibrated probability distribution among the available options. We show the calibration chart for all multiple
choice BIG Bench tasks, in this format, in Figure 4. As can be seen in Figure 6, models are well-calibrated
(in this format) even for somewhat adversarial datasets like TruthfulQA3 [Lin et al., 2021], as well as for
QuALITY [Pang et al., 2021] and LogiQA [Liu et al., 2020].
3Though note that in this format, where the model sees its options before making a choice, we do not observe antiscaling with model size.

Figure 5 (left) We show expected calibration error versus normalized accuracy for all BIG Bench tasks;
the number of problems in each task is represented by the marker sizes. We do not find any noticeable
correlation between accuracy and calibration within BIG Bench. To normalize accuracies we linearly map
chance accuracy to 0, keeping perfect accuracy at 1. (right) We compare calibration for several variations
on BIG Bench evaluations: we vary between 0-shot and 5-shot, replace an answer option with "none of the
above", and compare our format with letter-labeled choices to the default BIG Bench formatting.
It is crucial that the model gets to see the answer choices explicitly before choosing amongst them; without
this, we would not expect a calibrated response, due to ambiguities and degeneracies among possible paraphrases and specializations of any given answer option (e.g. "Washington" vs "George Washington, the first
US president"). As can be seen in figure 5, task formatting is important for achieving excellent calibration,
and calibration improves as we pass from 0-shot to 5-shot evaluation. We expect calibration is also easier to
achieve with this format because each answer option corresponds to a single token (this isn’t the case in BIG
Bench by default, see appendix A.4).
To simplify the interpretation of results, we reduce calibration curves to a single number by computing the
expected calibration error (ECE), after binning the predictions in 10 equally-represented bins. On the right
of Figure 4 we show scaling trends for calibration on BIG Bench. We typically find good calibration 0-shot,
without any other prompt, though calibration improves as we pass from 0-shot to few-shot. We find that in
almost all cases, calibration improves with model size and capability. Accuracy on the tasks also improves
with model size, but as can be seen in Figure 5, we do not observe any obvious causal connection between
accuracy and calibration. For details on how we obtain calibration charts and ECE see Appendix A.
In what follows we will work to leverage these calibration results to ask language models to evaluate what
they do and do not know.
3 From Calibration to Knowing What You Know
If language models can answer multiple choice questions in a calibrated way, then one might hope that they
can apply this ability to evaluate their own outputs. That is, we can simply ask models to generate potential
answers to questions, and then have the model evaluate whether any of them are correct. In this section we
will begin to explore this idea by reformulating existing tasks. Then in section 4 we will study self-evaluation.
3.1 Replacing an Option with ‘None of the Above’ Harms Performance and Calibration
We have seen that language models can produce calibrated probabilities for multiple choice questions, at least
when the questions and choices are provided in the right format. However, to achieve this feat the model only
needs to determine the relative weight for several concrete options, when they are compared to each other.
We are more interested in whether the model actually knows whether each of the answer options is correct,
when judged independently. To probe this question, we modified our multiple choice evaluations by replacing
their final option with “none of the above”. This procedure can make questions that do not actually have a
unique correct answer ambiguous or impossible, but for many tasks it should result in a well-defined new
evaluation. In particular this procedure appears to be sensible for the vast majority of questions in MMLU.
Concretely this means that we took questions such as the example in section 2 and replaced them with:

like LogiQA, and on a somewhat adversarial evaluation like TruthfulQA, large models can achieve good
calibration when the available answer options are presented to them in a favorable format. We include a

The latter makes calibration much worse, and in particular the model seems strongly biased against using this

Parameters
Figure 8 We show calibration curves for various model sizes on all of the multiple choice tasks in BIG
Bench, reformulated as True/False questions on a mix of the correct answers, and randomly chosen incorrect
answer options. The 52B model is very well-calibrated except near the tails, where it is overconfident.
Question: Who was the first president of the United States?
Choices:
(A) Barack Obama
(B) George Washington
(C) none of the above
Answer:
We found that this procedure degraded performance very significantly on evaluations; results for MMLU are
shown in Figure 36 in the appendix. Furthermore, adding "none of the above" also harms calibration, as can
be seen in Figures 5 and 7. It seems that even the 52B model is biased against using the “none of the above”
option and failed to use it with appropriate frequency. This is particularly surprising for 5-shot evaluations;
we also tried evaluating 20-shot and this also did not improve performance.
3.2 Models are Well-Calibrated on True/False Tasks
We saw in section 3.1 that language models seem to be confused by a “none of the above” option. Here we
take a different approach, and simply ask models if a given answer is true or false. So we use the format:
Question: Who was the first president of the United States?
Proposed Answer: George Washington
Is the proposed answer:
(A) True
(B) False
The proposed answer is:
where we expect either ‘ (A)’ or ‘ (B)’ as an answer. If the model responses are correct at more than chance
level, and especially if they are calibrated, then the probability P(True) indicates whether the model believes
a response is valid.
As a first test of this approach, we can use answer options from existing multiple choice tasks. For this
purpose, we take the correct answer and a randomly chosen incorrect answer, and create a new evaluation set
with twice as many problems in the format above, asking models to determine if each answer is correct. In
Figure 8 we show the calibration results from this method on BIG Bench. We see that the 52B model is quite
well-calibrated in this context. We show similar results for MMLU in Figure 36 in the appendix, and scaling
trends comparing a variety of evaluation methods in Figure 7.

Figure 9 We show calibration curves for RLHF policies finetuned from our language models. Calibration
of these models appears to be very poor, but simply adjusting the temperature of their probability distributions
to T = 2.5 largely fixes calibration issues for three different evaluations.
3.3 RLHF Policy Miscalibration Can Be Remediated with a Temperature Tuning
Our focus in this paper is on pure language models, but as a quick experiment we also looked at calibration for
a helpful and harmless RLHF policy, trained exactly as in [Bai et al., 2022] using the base language models
we are studying here. We find that these policies naively appear very miscalibrated, which is not surprising,
since RL finetuning tends to collapse language model predictions towards behaviors that receive the most
reward. However, a simple temperature adjustment (with the same temperature T = 2.5 for all evaluations)
largely fixes calibration issues with several independent evaluation tasks, with results shown in Figure 9. This
also matches what was found for gender bias evaluations in [Bai et al., 2022], where RLHF policies had a
bias score very similar to a basic language model evaluated at lower temperature. Of course more intensive
RL training might distort calibration in ways that cannot be remedied in this way, but this at least provides
hope that good calibration can survive some forms of finetuning.
4 Ask the AI: Is your proposed answer True or False?
We will now apply the True/False approach from section 3.2 to the samples models generated when trying
to answer questions, including the short answer tasks arithmetic, Lambada, and TriviaQA, and the longform answer tasks Codex HumanEval and GSM8k (technically GSM8k calls for a short answer, but we
will be evaluating full written solution attempts, which have been solicited via chain-of-thought/scratchpad
[Nye et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2022] prompting). We show the accuracies when sampling at a temperature of
one in Figure 1.
In almost all cases self-evaluation performance improves with model size, and for our 52B models answers
labeled with P(True) > 50% are far more likely to be correct as compared to generic responses (see the
summary histogram and comparisons in Figure 1). We also find that showing the model many T = 1 samples
for a single question significantly improves its ability to evaluate whether any given sample is correct. This is
somewhat reminiscent of self-consistency [Wang et al., 2022], though here we are showing models their own
samples, rather than externally judging self-consistency ourselves. One way to summarize these results is via
the Brier scores for self-evaluation, which are shown in Figure 11.
We provide complete results in appendix C; since there are quite a few figures we only show representative
examples from Lambada and Codex in the main text.
4.1 Basic Self-Evaluation
In section 3.2 we saw that large language models are well-calibrated on True/False questions. Our primary
motivation for studying this issue was to ask language models about their own outputs. That is, we are
interested in a process where we first ask a question like:
Question: Who was the first president of the United States?
Answer:
and sample a response from the model. Then we ask the model about its own sample:
Question: Who was the first president of the United States?
Proposed Answer: George Washington was the first president.

Figure 10 Models self-evaluate their own samples by producing a probability P(True) that the samples are
in fact correct. Here we show histograms of P(True) for the correct and incorrect samples, in the evaluation
paradigm where models also see five T = 1 samples for the same question, in order to improve their judgment. Here we show results only for Lambada and Codex, as these are fairly representative of short-answer
and long-answer behavior; for full results see Figure 28 in the appendix.
Is the proposed answer:
(A) True
(B) False
The proposed answer is:
and evaluate the probabilities it assigns to the ‘ (A)’ and ‘ (B)’ options. We apply this approach to model generated answers from TriviaQA [Joshi et al., 2017], Lambada [Paperno et al., 2016], the Codex HumanEval
[Chen et al., 2021], GSM8k [Cobbe et al., 2021], and basic arithmetic problems.
This True/False self-evaluation may be considerably more difficult than the tasks we studied in section 3.2,
because there the model was presented with human-written possibilities, whereas here the model is forced to
evaluate4 its own samples. These samples may lie close to the model’s own decision boundary for validity
(or the model may simply be overconfident about its own samples), whereas options presented to the model
by a third party may be easier to categorize. We observe this effect in several ways. Zero-shot, P(True) is
poorly calibrated, and typically it lies close to 50% for typical samples (see Figure 38 in the appendix for
illustrations). Furthermore, we show in Figure 33 in the appendix that samples from smaller models are
universally easier to categorize as correct or incorrect, for models of all sizes.
4.2 Showing Many T = 1 Samples Improves Self-Evaluation
We can improve performance further by showing the model other T = 1 samples, for comparison. That is,
we generate 5 samples in total, and then ask the model about the validity of one of these samples:
Question: Who was the third president of the United States?
Here are some brainstormed ideas: James Monroe
Thomas Jefferson
John Adams
Thomas Jefferson
George Washington
Possible Answer: James Monroe
Is the possible answer:
(A) True
(B) False
The possible answer is:
With this format, performance improves significantly on all of the short-form answer tasks, as compared to
the version where we only show models a single proposed answer, as summarized in Figure 11. However,
4Language models do not typically have an explicit way of knowing if tokens were provided to them by a third party,
or are their own samples. This may make self-evaluation more difficult (or at least ambiguous), and can have other issues
in an RL setting [Ortega et al., 2021].

Figure 11 Here we show results only for Lambada and Codex, as these are fairly representative of shortanswer and long-answer behavior; for full results see Figures 28, 29, 30, and 31 in the appendix. Top: Here
we show the Brier scores for model self-evaluation with three methods: basic self-evaluation with a prompt,
and self-evaluation with comparison samples, either with a fixed prompt or 20-shot. Note that the Brier score
combines accuracy of the True/False determination with calibration, and 20-shot evaluation with comparison
samples performs best in every case. Brier scores do not decrease with model size on evaluations like Codex
because small model samples are almost always invalid, so that it’s relatively trivial to achieve a small Brier
score. Bottom: We show the base accuracy of our models on various sampling tasks, and then the accuracy
among the responses where via self-evaluation we have P(True) > 0.5. For P(True) we evaluate with a single
example and a prompt, and then both 20-shot and with a prompt with five comparison examples. Few-shot
evaluation is important for obtaining good calibration.
models benefit less from this approach on tasks requiring long-form answers (Codex and GMS8k). As noted
in the last section, calibration of P(True) is relatively poor zero-shot, but it improves few-shot. In Figure 32
in the appendix we show the full calibration curves for 20-shot True/False self-evaluation.
A pragmatic comparison of self-evaluation techniques can be seen on the bottom of Figure 11. There we
directly compare the overall accuracy of our models at the task, to the accuracies for the subset of responses
where the models chose P(True) > 0.5. We see that these conditional accuracies are substantially higher
than the overall accuracy, with the separation between base and conditional accuracies growing with model
size. This suggests that as capabilities improve and samples become more sophisticated, models seem to
demonstrate relative improvement at self-evaluation, compared to their generative ability. This accords with
the intuitive sense that verification is often easier than generation.
Overall, if given a few examples from a given distribution, models can generate samples and then self-evaluate
them to productively differentiate correct and incorrect samples, with reasonably calibrated confidence.

5 Training Models to Predict Whether They Can Answer Questions Correctly
In this section, we will train models to predict whether they know the answer to any given free-form question,
denoting the probability they assign as ‘P(IK)’ (for Probability that I Know the answer). This is fundamentally
a question about the model itself, as different models will know the answers to different questions.
We considered two approaches:
• Value Head: We train P(IK) as the logit from an additional value ‘head’ added to the model (independent of the logits for language modeling). An advantage of this approach is that we can easily
probe P(IK) at general token positions.
• Natural Language: We train P(IK) by asking the model to literally address "With what confidence
could you answer this question?", and output an answer like 0%, 10%, 20%, · · · 100%.
We had hoped to observe large benefits from few-shot evaluation out-of-distribution with the natural language
approach. In early experiments we did not observe major gains, and so we will use the value head approach
in what follows. But we believe it would be worth returning to the natural language approach in the future.
For each question, we generated 30 answer samples at T = 1. For a given question Q, if 20 of the model’s
sampled answers were correct, and 10 were incorrect, our training set contained 20 copies of the (Q, IK)
datapoint and 10 copies of the (Q, IDK) datapoint. This was a convenience to allow us to easily approximate5
a soft label for the ground-truth P(IK) by using many hard labels. We trained with a cross-entropy loss on
these labels.
Figure 3 gives some examples of P(IK) scores from a 52 billion parameter model on a few example questions
where the model obviously should or should not know the answers. Note that the value head is technically
present at every token position. However, during training, we only backpropagate the loss through the head
at the last token position of the input sequence. At test time, we also read off the P(IK) score for any given
sequence as the output from our head at the final token position.
5.1 Evaluating P(IK) Training and Model Size Trends
Because we’re adding a new untrained head, language models do not perform well zero or few-shot at predicting P(IK), so we need to finetune them. Since TriviaQA has a large training set, we explore generalization
by finetuning P(IK) only on trivia questions. In order to obtain ground-truth P(IK) scores that we use for
training, we sample 30 answers (at temperature = 1) from each TriviaQA question with a 10-shot prompt
constructed from other random TriviaQA questions and answers. We use a 10-shot prompt simply to ensure
that the models almost always output answers in the correct format, which is important because correctness
on TriviaQA questions is judged based on a string comparison.
Our dataset for training and evaluating the classifier then contains datapoints of the form (Few-Shot Prompt
+ Question, Ground Truth Label). During P(IK) training, we finetune the entire model along with the value
head. In Figure 12, we then evaluate this classifier on a held-out set of TriviaQA test questions, and see that
the model is able to separate the questions it got correct and incorrect quite well. In particular, P(IK) is very
well calibrated on TriviaQA. As a note, in a later section we train P(IK) on Lambada, Arithmetic, and Python
Function Synthesis problems as well. We used a 10-shot prompt for both Lambada and Arithmetic, while
Python Function Synthesis was done 0-shot.
5.2 Out of Distribution Generalization of P(IK)
Next, we study the generalization of P(IK) when training only on TriviaQA and then evaluating on Lambada,
Arithmetic, GSM8k, Codex HumanEval, and a set of ‘naturally occurring’ python function synthesis tasks
scraped from GitHub (we added this test set because the Codex evaluation is not very large). We are interested
in how generalization scales across model sizes, and how performance compares to the case where we do train
P(IK) on these distributions.
We treat GSM8k slightly differently, since it was harder than other tasks. As for TriviaQA, we generated 30
samples @ T = 1 per question from GSM8k using a 10-shot prompt of examples to ensure proper formatting.
5In some cases P(IK) could be somewhat misleading – for instance, Owain Evans pointed out the nice example "Name
a composite integer in the range [1,100]?" where by chance the model may achieve an apparent P(IK) = 0.75 simply by
randomly sampling integers in [1,100].

Figure 18 Effect of including Wikipedia article on P(IK) for TriviaQA Questions. We see that including a
relevant Wikipedia article in the context boosts the average P(IK) on TriviaQA Questions. P(IK) increases
more for shorter Wikipedia articles, from which it is presumably easier to identify the relevant facts.
then the P(IK) score rises to 78%. In other words, without any further training, P(IK) generalizes to address
whether the language model can find answers to questions in source materials within its context.
We demonstrate this phenomenon quantitatively using questions from TriviaQA, by comparing P(IK) evaluated both with and without accompanying reference material. Questions from TriviaQA come with Wikipedia
documents that are relevant to each questions. For each question, we then compute P(IK) both with an without
the reference document. Specifically, the format for the prompts are as follows:
With Background Material:
Here is some background information material: <BACKGROUND_MATERIAL>
Now, answer the following question.
Question: Which Lloyd Webber musical premiered in the US on 10th
December 1993?
Answer:
Without Background Material:
Question: Which Lloyd Webber musical premiered in the US on 10th
December 1993?
Answer:
Whenever the full article was excessively long, we needed to truncate it to 7000 tokens so that the article and
the question would always fit in the model context. Figure 18 summarizes the effects of including Wikipedia
articles on P(IK). We see that including the article increases P(IK). Furthermore, shorter articles increase
P(IK) more. Presumably this is because the correct answer is easier to extract from shorter articles than
longer articles.
5.4 P(IK) Generalizes to Account for Hints Towards GSM8k Solutions
In this section we study how hints towards the solution of GSM8k problems affect P(IK) scores. Specifically,
we add hints to the problem statement using the following format:
Question: Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior
. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the
class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50
points. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. Marta
managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points
less than Betty. How many points is the class missing to go on the
trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?

P(IK) Scores on Good & Bad Hints
Good Hints (From Ground Truth Soln.)
Bad Model-Generated Hints
Hints from Other Questions
Figure 19 Effect of hints on P(IK) applied to GSM8k – all of these results represent generalization, as the
models were not trained on GSM8k. Left: We see that showing more of the GSM8k hint results in higher
P(IK). The effect is more consistent for the model trained on all 4 tasks (TriviaQA, LAMBADA, Arithmetic,
and Python Function Synthesis), rather than the one trained on just TriviaQA. Right: We evaluate the model
trained on all 4 other tasks on various hints. We see lower P(IK) scores for bad hints (though the models
are partially fooled), and actual decreases in the P(IK) score when the hints are irrelevant because they come
from other questions.
Here is a hint: Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it’s 30/100 * 50
= <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty’s total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35
points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 =
<<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 =
<<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on
the trip.
Answer:
We test two variations on hints. First, we vary the amount of information given away by the hint by truncating
hints at fixed fractions of their total length. Second, we compare how P(IK) is affected by good, incorrect,
and distracting hints. Bad hints are acquired by generating chain-of-thought samples from our 52B model
and selecting only the samples that lead to an incorrect answer. Distracting hints are simply hints that were
generated for a different question, so that they are irrelevant to the question at hand.
Figure 19 shows the result of evaluating GSM8k problems with hints using our 52B P(IK) model. We see
that (1) showing more of the hint generally leads to higher P(IK), (2) good hints that lead to the correct
answer result in higher P(IK) scores than bad hints, and (3) the P(IK) model that was trained on TriviaQA,
LAMBADA, Arithmetic, and Python Function Synthesis performs better and more consistently, especially
with partial hints.
5.5 Comparing Models Trained with Distinct Pretraining Distributions
We would like P(IK) to truly capture model self-knowledge. Thus we would like to distinguish between this
and an alternative hypothesis, that P(IK) is merely capturing something like the intrinsic difficulty of tasks.
In order to try to disentangle these explanations, we studied two 12B models (with identical architecture)
that were pretrained on distinct data distributions – one was trained with four repetitions of a high quality
dataset, while the other uses a single copy of that dataset mixed with a single copy of a larger but lowerquality distribution of webdata. We refer to these pretrained language models as A and B in this section. We
finetuned both models for P(IK) on the questions from the TriviaQA training set that each model got correct.
These models get many of the same questions correct and incorrect. So our focus here will be on the subset
of questions that one model answers correctly and the other incorrectly. In the TriviaQA test set there were
20

Questions that only A gets right Questions only B gets right
A’s average P(IK) 0.463 0.408
B’s average P(IK) 0.409 0.477
Table 2 ‘Cross-Experiments’: Average P(IK) from for two distinct models on subsets of TriviaQA questions
where one model is correct and the other is wrong. We see that the entries in the major diagonal are larger
than the entries in the minor diagonal, showing that there is some signal that P(IK) is encoding model-specific
information. However, the difference in P(IK) is only around 6%, so there is room for improvement from
future work.

650 and 826 such questions, respectively, that model A or B got correct but that the other got wrong. Table
2 shows that each model has a noticeably higher P(IK) for the questions that they get correct, compared to
the questions that the other model gets right. In Figure 20 we show a scatter plot of P(IK) for models A and
B, colored by which model got the questions right. The differences between the distributions are small but
noticeable.
We also tried a second experiment, in order to try to get insight as to whether P(IK) leverages features
specifically relevant to self-knowledge. For this purpose we finetuned both the A and B pretrained models
on the ground-truth P(IK) data from each model. So for example, we started from model A, and finetuned
it on the ground-truth P(IK) data from model A and, separately, on the data from model B (resulting in two
distinct finetuned snapshots). We might hope to find that training a P(IK) classifier to predict whether or not
model A knows the answer to a question would work better when starting from model A itself as the initial
checkpoint, as compared to if we start from model B. Table 3 contains results for this experiment.
We find mixed but encouraging results here: when testing on the ground-truth P(IK) data from model A, both
starting from model A and starting from model B seems to give comparable performance. However, when
testing on ground-truth P(IK) data from model B, starting from model B seems to do better than starting from
model A. We also tried focusing on only the questions where the two models differ, but we found similar
results in that case.

Table 3 ‘Cross-Experiments’: We trained P(IK) classifiers on the ground-truth data from two models, starting from both models. Ideally, starting from pretrained model X should do better than starting from model
Y when training P(IK) using data from model X. We see some signal that starting from model B does better
than starting from model A when testing on data from model B. However, we see no difference between both
initializations when testing on data from model A.
6 Discussion
The long-term motivation underlying this work is to begin to understand aspects of honesty in AI models. We
use honesty as an umbrella term including several overlapping7 ideas:
• Truthfulness: Does the AI provide factually accurate information, including finding, using, and
evaluating source materials correctly?
• Calibration: Do the AI’s probabilistic predictions correspond with frequencies of occurrence?
• Self-knowledge: Do AI systems know what they know and make accurate predictions about their
own behavior and reasoning?
• Explainability: Do AI systems reveal their ‘thinking’ completely and faithfully?
• Non-deceptiveness: Can we ensure AI systems do not learn to lie (e.g. when human preference data
might encourage systematic mistakes or provide more reward for pleasant misconceptions)?
Here we have focused on aspects of calibration, self-knowledge, and truthfulness, but we are only scratching
the surface of the larger subject. Our core findings are that large language models can be well-calibrated on
diverse multiple choice questions, that they perform well at self-evaluation on a range of subjects, and that
they can be trained to predict what they do and don’t know and exhibit some generalization to new domains
and in-context information sources.
We found that calibration tends to improve with model size/capability and with additional few-shot examples.
Self-evaluation also improves with model size, which is non-trivial since we expect the quality of model
samples to also be improving as we scale up. This means that in effect, we are observing that verification
has an advantage over generation. Within the scope of pretrained language models, we find these results
encouraging, and expect they can be usefully leveraged to bootstrap more extensive forms of self or intermodel supervision, and to distill calibration back into open-ended natural language responses.
Another motivation for this work was to use self-knowledge as a test-bed for generalization. We are particularly interested in how honesty generalizes from easy to hard questions and across domains, because we are
worried about how AI systems may behave out-of-distribution, or when they have some knowledge or insight that humans lack. We found that language models do exhibit a degree of generalization across domains,
though calibration suffers out-of-distribution. We also found that although models are trained to predict P(IK)
for standalone questions, they generalize in such a way that P(IK) increases significantly when models are
provided with source materials that contain the answers to these questions, or hints towards the solution of
math word problems. This suggests a relationship between the way models store longterm memory and the
way they use information within their contexts, i.e. it suggests a connection between learning and in-context
learning.
6.1 Limitations and Future Work
This work has a number of limitations:
7We are not attempting a precise taxonomy, but simply pointing at a collection of important ideas.
22

• We have focused on pretrained language models, but models that have been finetuned for a specific
purpose, such as RLHF policies [Bai et al., 2022], will not be so well-calibrated, and some of the
methods we discussed may not work as well.
• Furthermore, language model pretraining is a form of human imitation. Some of the most interesting
questions about honesty concern setups where advanced AI systems ‘know’ something that clashes
with or extends what humans know, and so cannot have been grasped from pretraining. Our analysis
does not differentiate between "the truth" and "what humans say", but eventually we would like to
train AI systems that recognize this distinction and generalize appropriately.
• This work does not address the possibility that AI systems may learn to behave deceptively (in order
to e.g. maximize human preference rewards), and intentional deception would counteract simple
trends in honest self-evaluation.
• We were interested in the generalization of honesty because we would like to predict whether AI
systems will extrapolate from training to exhibit safe and desirable behavior in new contexts. We
found some interesting and potentially encouraging forms of generalization. But we only studied
five sampling-based datasets, and our observations concerning capability trends and generalization
were limited in power and scope. It would be interesting to investigate these more thoroughly and
precisely.
With that said, we believe that the simple methods we have demonstrated here lay the foundation for investigating some of these issues in the future.
6.2 Broader Impacts
We hope that the broader impacts of this work will be positive. Pretrained language models and other AI
systems can be dishonest in a number of ways, and we hope that this work will make it easier to identify
and correct failures of honesty in deployed systems. That said, pretrained language models may have other
failure modes, and the interventions we study here may not correct errors that are perpetuated by language
model training data and human imitation.

A Metrics, Formatting Details, and P(IK) Training
A.1 Calibration Charts
To evaluate calibration on multiple choice problems, we obtain a list of all probabilities for all answer options
(both correct and incorrect choices). We then sort these probabilities and bin them into 10 groups, each
with an equal number of probabilities. We obtain the x-coordinate of calibration charts by computing the
mean probability in each of these bins. To obtain the y-coordinate, we compute the fraction of the options
that actually correspond to a correct answer within each bin. The result is a calibration chart such as Figure
6. Our method differs slightly from some others in the literature [Guo et al., 2017, Srivastava et al., 2022,
Lin et al., 2022], where only the probabilities for the top prediction are included.
A.2 Expected Calibration Error
To compute the ECE, we simply evaluate
N
1 (cid:88)
E = |y − x | (A.1)
N i i
i
for the (x , y ) coordinates of our calibration charts (which have equal numbers of predictions in each bin).
i i
This results in plots like Figure 4. Note however that when computing the ECE we only use the top predictions
for each multiple choice question, as this seems to be the convention in the literature (this change results in a
larger ECE, compared to if we had used all predictions).
We also evaluate the RMS Calibration Error
(cid:118)
(cid:117) N

which appears less often in the literature, though it has a sounder theoretical basis.
24

A.3 Brier Score
We use the standard prior score of
N
1 (cid:88)
B = (p − c )2 (A.3)
N i i
i
where p = P(True) for any given sample (i.e. the model’s self-evaluated probability that it’s sample was
i
correct), and c is 0 if the sample is incorrect, and 1 if it is correct. In contexts where many samples have
i
been generated at unit temperature, we binarize the ground-truth P(IK) via 1{Ground-Truth P(IK) > 0.5}.
A.4 BIG Bench Default Format
By default in BIG Bench [Srivastava et al., 2022] questions are posed in this way:
Question: Who was the first president of the United States?
choice: Barack Obama
choice: George Washington
choice: Michael Jackson
Answer:
Here models are required to re-write the complete responses. We find that calibration is poorer in this format,
compared to a format with lettered choices, and where models need only write that letter.
A.5 Prompt for Self-Evaluation
We used this prompt for self-evaluation of P(True), when not taking a few-shot approach (which performs
best, as it improves significantly on calibration). This was simply the first prompt we tried, and it was not
otherwise optimized. It contains six examples, with some similarity to arithmetic, trivia, and fill-in-theblank completions. This version contains extra "brainstormed" examples; we also used an otherwise identical
version without these examples for the types of evaluation discussed in section 4.1:

A.6 Training for P(IK)
In order to train P(IK) classifiers, we created datase
question Q, such as a TriviaQA question that include
samples at T = 1. See Appendix A.7 for details on t
each candidate answer sample as either correct or
datapoint (Q, True Label) based on whether or not th
we have 30 datapoints of (Q, True Label). This is d
many hard labels.
During fine-tuning, we used a batch size of 7680, a
learning rate. We noticed that using a larger than nor
noisy soft training labels.
The evaluation datasets are constructed similarly to
puting ground truth P(IK) scores for each question,
ground truth P(IK) is simply the fraction of T = 1
ground truth P(IK) score to the model’s predicted P

Question: Verna loves to eat fruit. She bought three apples at $1.50
each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each. If
she gave $20, how much change did she receive?
Answer: three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.
four peaches cost 6 x $0.75 = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50.
thus, verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.
therefore, verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.

answer to and problems it doesn’t know the answer to. Left: On TriviaQA, we see that the loss on the T = 0
sample is more commonly lower for answers that are correct. Right: On Codex HumanEval, we see that the
loss on the T = 0 sample is somewhat indicative of the accuracy of the T=1 samples. Specifically, we see
that our model performs poorly in terms of pass@k on all questions that resulted in a high loss on the T=0
sample.

B Discriminating What Models Know with Entropy or Loss
In this section we will compare methods that attempt to discriminate correct and incorrect samples, without
achieving calibration.
B.1 Loss of the Sample
A very simple method is to generate a sample, and then look at the model’s loss on this sample, averaged over
all tokens. This has some power to discriminate between correct and incorrect samples, as shown in Figure
22 and 23.
We considered summing the loss across all tokens as well. However, this would make the length of the candidate solution a confounding variable. For many evals, such as Codex HumanEval, more difficult questions
naturally require longer answers.

HumanEval: Entropy vs pass@1 (52B Model)
Figure 24 Entropy of samples from the 52B model on TriviaQA and HumanEval. On the left, we see that
the TriviaQA questions that the model gets correct and incorrect at T = 0 have different entropy distributions.
The average entropy of the questions the model gets correct is lower than that of the questions the model gets
incorrect. On the right, we compute the entropy and pass@1 over many samples from each question in
HumanEval. We see that as the entropy of the answer distribution decreases, models get higher pass@1
scores.
B.2 Entropy of the Answer Distribution
One hypothesis about model hallucinations is that they are diverse. Specifically, we hypothesize that when
a model knows the answer to a particular question, it is confident in its response, and sampling the answer
many times at T = 1 would result in an answer distribution with small entropy. Conversely, when a model
is unsure about its response, it will start "hallucinating" responses, leading to an answer distribution with
high entropy. In order to investigate this, we sample N = 200 answers from each question and estimate the
entropy of the answer distribution for a given question H(A|Q) as:
(cid:34) (cid:35)
(cid:88)
H(A|Q) = E [− log P(A|Q)] = E − log P(a |Q, a , · · · a )
A sampled from model A i 0 i−1
ai tokens of A
In Figure 24, we look at how well H(A|Q) performs as a signal for which questions the model gets correct
vs. incorrect. The distribution of H(A|Q) looks different depending on whether or not the model got the
question correct, indicating that it has some predictive power. In Figure 25, we show model size trends
for the AUROC using H(A|Q) for many evals. It’s interesting to note the negative trend of AUROC on
HumanEval as we increase model size. We found that larger models solve harder HumanEval problems, but
also often give a diverse set of correct answers. This is in conflict with the original hypothesis that when a
model knows the answer to a question, its answer distribution is not diverse. Because larger models are able
to give more diverse and correct answers, we believe that H(A|Q) is not a robust measure of whether or not
a model knows the answer to a question, especially as models increase in size.
B.3 Loss of Sampled Answers Stuffed into a Single Context
Another way to measure diversity is to stuff many answer samples in the context of an LLM and compute
the standard token-level language modelling loss on the stuffed context. We can then use the loss on the
entire stuffed context as a measure of if the model knows the answer or not. The idea here is similar to the
idea with the Entropy method - questions that the model knows the answer to will have less diverse answer
distributions.
Here, we stuff 30 model-generated samples at T = 1 in the context window and compute the mean token
loss across the sequence. We choose to take the mean token loss so that results aren’t confounded by the
length of the sampled answers, since for benchmarks like HumanEval, the length of correct answers tends
to be correlated with the difficulty of the question. See Figure 26 and Figure 27 for results. We see that
this method has some discriminative power for differentiating whether or not the model knows the answer.
However, as expected, we see the a negative model size trend for Codex HumanEval. See Section B.2 for a
short discussion on this negative trend - we believe that the same intuition applies here.

before it makes its judgment. Evaluating few-shot is crucial for obtaining good calibration for P(True),
though it appears that the prompt actually performs better than few-shot for codex and GSM8k, possibly
because these have long-form answers.

Figure 35 We show calibration curves for a subset of tasks that have both a large number of questions (for
better statistics) and fairly bad calibration.

Figure 37 (left) We show accuracies on the specific multiple choice tasks we evaluate, MMLU, TruthfulQA, QuALITY, and LogiQA. (right) We show accuracy for MMLU in the True/False format, where the
model must identify if a possible response to a question is true or false. Chance accuracy is 0.5. In order
to connect with other methods that do not produce calibrated probabilities, we also show the AUROC when
using the probabilities assigned to True/False to separate the correct and incorrect responses.

Figure 38 Models self-evaluate their samples by producing a probability P(True) that the samples are in
fact correct. Here we show histograms of P(True) for the correct and incorrect samples for each evaluation, in
the evaluation paradigm where models also get to see a total of five T = 1 samples for the same question, in
order to improve their judgment. P(True) provides very noticeable separation between correct and incorrect
samples with the 52B model, but the probability itself is not calibrated. In particular, almost all samples
from arithmetic questions have P(True) > 0.5. These evaluations are all zero-shot, but they include a humanwritten prompt with six examples.
