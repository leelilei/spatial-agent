Abstract
While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive accomplishments in
both reasoning and planning, their abilities
in multi-agent collaborations remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates LLMbased agents in a multi-agent cooperative text
game with Theory of Mind (ToM) inference
tasks, comparing their performance with MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and
planning-based baselines.1 We observed evidence of emergent collaborative behaviors and
high-order Theory of Mind capabilities among
LLM-based agents. Our results reveal limitations in LLM-based agents’ planning optimization due to systematic failures in managing
long-horizon contexts and hallucination about
the task state. We explore the use of explicit
belief state representations to mitigate these issues, finding that it enhances task performance
and the accuracy of ToM inferences for LLMbased agents.
1 Introduction
Recent large language models (LLMs), such as
GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), have demonstrated impressive competencies across a wide array of domains and tasks, ranging from mathematics to law,
without the need for fine-tuning or special prompting (Bubeck et al., 2023). This advancement has
significantly transformed the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. Instead
of developing domain-specific models for downstream applications, focus has shifted towards evaluating and harnessing LLMs’ abilities to solve
novel tasks. Such a shift is consistent with the
idea of studying machine behaviors, an interdisciplinary approach that expands the conventional
bounds of computer science and integrates insights
from diverse scientific fields (Rahwan et al., 2019).
Drawing inspiration from team science and group

psychology (Hagendorff, 2023), our study concentrates on collective machine behavior, evaluating
LLMs’ proficiency in multi-agent collaborations.
There is ongoing debate regarding the intelligence levels of modern LLMs. While some argue
that LLMs excel primarily in linguistic competence
and struggle with cognitive abilities beyond language, known as functional competence, others
demonstrate that LLMs can exhibit cognitive skills
such as formal reasoning and world knowledge
comprehension (Mahowald et al., 2023; Bubeck
et al., 2023). Motivated to explore this argument,
we designed a text-based game to evaluate LLMs’
ability in embodied interactions, including exploring unknown environments, maintaining beliefs
about the world and collaborating with other agents,
which is critical for natural social interactions and
artificial general intelligence (AGI).
Theory of Mind, the capacity to reason about
others’ concealed mental states, is fundamental
to human social interactions, collaborations, and
communications (Zhang et al., 2012). As LLMs
increasingly participate in diverse social interactions with humans, their social intelligence is expected to improve for them to become effective collaborators (Williams et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022).
For instance, a proficient AI assistant should be
able to infer a human’s preferences based on previous experiences without needing to ask. Recent
studies have applied classic Theory-of-Mind tasks
to several LLMs, concluding that current models (e.g., GPT-4) perform comparably to 9-yearold children (Kosinski, 2023). However, the research community has expressed doubts about the
validity of text-based ToM tests on machine intelligence(Ullman, 2023; Sap et al., 2023). In response,
our study proposes a novel evaluation of LLMs’
high-order ToM in interactive teamwork scenarios, encompassing dynamic belief state evolution
and rich intent communication between multiple
agents.

The main contributions of this study include that
we:
• Evaluate LLM-based agents’ embodied interaction capability in multi-agent collaborative tasks against reinforcement learning and
planning-based baselines
• Identify systematic failures that limit the collaboration efficiency of LLM-based agents,
and propose a prompt-engineering method to
mitigate those failures by incorporating explicit belief state representations about world
knowledge in the model input
• Propose a novel evaluation of LLMs’ highorder ToM in interactive teamwork scenarios,
encompassing dynamic belief state evolution
and rich intent communication between multiple agents

2.1 Large language models
Large language models, trained on vast text
corpora, excel in text completion and various
other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al.,
2022). Recent studies highlight their abilities for
reasoning (Bubeck et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022)
and action plan generation (Liu et al., 2023; Xie
et al., 2023), particularly when utilizing prompt engineering techniques like chain-of-thought. However, some researchers note these models’ limitations in forming actionable plans when interacting
with real-world objects (Ahn et al., 2022; Huang
et al., 2022). GPT-4’s capacity for embodied interactions via text-based games and real-world problems was assessed by Bubeck et al. (2023). Further
studies explored the potential of LLM-powered embodied agents in Minecraft (Wang et al., 2023b,a).
These investigations suggest that LLMs can perform tasks requiring environment understanding,
task comprehension, action planning, feedback interpretation, and subsequent adaptation. Our study
seeks to broaden this understanding by evaluating LLMs’ planning abilities in cooperative multiagent scenarios.
2.2 Theory of Mind
Prior research has tested LLMs’ Theory of Mind
(ToM) via variants of text-based tests such as the
unexpected transfer task (also known as Smarties

Task) or unexpected contents task (also known as
the “Maxi Task” or “Sally–Anne” Test) (Kosinski,
2023; Moghaddam and Honey, 2023). Results indicate that leading LLMs can pass more than 90% of
these test cases. In contrast, Ullman (2023) found
that LLMs struggle with complex ToM inferences
involving communication or second-order beliefs.
In our study, ToM evaluations occur in the midst of
an interactive team task, where the mental states of
agents change dynamically with each interaction.
As agents exchange information through communication at every timestamp, the complexity of reasoning increases, since agents’ mental states may
be updated through both observations and communication. Thus, our tests can be considered more
challenging than the static text-based tests used in
prior research.
Theory of Mind (ToM) has been employed to enhance the performance of artificial agents in various
contexts. Lim et al. (2020) introduced a method to
integrate Bayesian Theory of Mind (BToM) (Baker
et al., 2017) with optimal-planning agents in a cooperative game. The results indicate that an explicit
representation of others’ intentions enhances the
performance of both agent-only and human-agent
teams. SymbolicToM allows language models to
maintain an explicit symbolic ToM for multiple
characters in reading comprehension tasks using
graphical representations (Sclar et al., 2023). Moreover, there is a significant body of research focusing
on the application of ToM to boost collaboration in
multi-agent reinforcement learning (Oguntola et al.,
2023; Yuan et al., 2021). Inspired by these prior
studies, we aim to enhance LLM-based agents’ collaborative behaviors through explicit belief representations.
2.3 Multi-agent collaboration
Team science researchers have studied human collaborative behaviors for decades, covering topics
such as leadership, communication, team dynamics, team cohesion, and shared situation awareness (Riedl et al., 2021). However, the transferability of these findings to hybrid human-agent
teams or fully automated teams remains largely unexplored. Park et al. (2023) utilized ChatGPT to
operate a sandbox environment populated by generative agents, observing emergent social behaviors
among LLM-based agents. That study primarily focused on the feasibility of running such a sandbox
environment with LLMs, rather than specifically

on the collaborative behaviors of machine intelligence.
3 Multi-agent Collaboration Tasks
To evaluate the capability of LLM-based embodied agents, we design a multi-agent environment
to simulate the collaborative and problem-solving
dynamics of a search and rescue mission.
3.1 Task environment
3 agents (i.e. Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie) emulate
specialists in a team, with the objective to locate
and safely defuse color-coded bombs scattered in
an unexplored environment. Each bomb exhibits
unique phase sequences in m colors, requiring the
correct order of wire cutters for defusing. Team
members start with different colored cutters and
must coordinate and synchronize efforts for efficiency. The environment is conceptualized as
a connected graph, with n nodes representing n
rooms linked by several edges symbolizing hallways. In each round, the agents can choose from
three classes of actions: moving to one of the n
rooms, inspecting a bomb’s phase sequence in the
current room, or using one of the m wire-cutters.
The size of action space depends on the problem
scale (i.e. n + m + 1). Agents’ observation are
limited to their current room’s contents and agent
status. They are updated periodically about team
scores, current room contents, teammates’ locations and available tools. The team is rewarded
10*x points when a x-phase bomb is successfully
defused.
The evaluation environment comprises five
rooms (n = 5) and five bombs, including two
single-phase, two double-phase, and one triplephase bombs. Bomb stages might have three different colors (m = 3). Each successfully defused
bomb awards the team 10 points per processed
phase, resulting in 90 as the maximum score per
mission. Team performance is measured using two
metrics: the team score, indicating coordination
quality, and rounds to completion, measuring collaboration efficiency. A trial concludes when the
team has defused all bombs, exceeded the time
limit (i.e., 30 rounds), or entered a deadlock by
repeating outputs.
3.2 Text game interface
The initial task environment is implemented for
MARL agents based on gym API (Brockman et al.,

2016). To facilitate interaction between LLMbased agents with the environment, we’ve integrated the task environment with a text interface.
At each round (i.e. timestamp), the team’s three
agents sequentially interact with the environment,
both receiving observations and performing actions via natural language interaction. A built-in
communication mechanism enables text message
exchange among agents per round. Importantly,
agents remain oblivious to each other’s actions and
outcomes unless communicated, facilitating Theory of Mind inference opportunities.
Specifically, a rule-based text interface translates
observations into natural language descriptions and
encodes agent chats into abstract action selections.
For observations, the text interface extracts state
features from the game engine and replaces keywords in the templates. A typical description text
includes the current round number, cumulative
team score, action feedback, contents of the current
room, teammates’ locations, and communication
messages. Action encoding is done via keyword
matching since LLMs are instructed to frame their
responses in a certain format and structure. Should
an agent produce unintelligible content, such as
invalid actions or nonsensical text, the interface
provides feedback for error correction. The error
messages are generated based on pre-programmed
rules and templates, such as "There is no bomb in
the current location, Room X, for you to inspect.".
Fig. 1 showcases sample interactions between the
agent team and task environment via the text interface.
4 LLM-based Embodied Agents
We chose to evaluate OpenAI’s latest chat completion models, namely gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 and gpt-40314, owing to their impressive performance in various benchmarks (Zheng et al., 2023). These models are prompted to engage in a text-based game,
with user inputs managed by the above-mentioned
game interface. The LLMs functions as embodied agents interacting within the task environment.
They are provided with the game’s rules as context.
For each round, the model is asked to choose actions and communicate messages, based on the current task state observations and past interaction history. Interaction history between the LLM-based
agent and text game interface are maintained in the
query text until it exceeds the maximum model input size. In our setup, all agents retain memory of

5.1 Setups
At the beginning of each experimental trial, we assemble a team of three embodied agents and reset
the task environment, randomizing starting locations, room connections, bomb distributions, and
sequences. Agents then take turns providing action choices and communication messages based
on their initial observations. It’s important to note
that each agent only has a partial observation and
its own interaction history, with inter-agent communication being the sole means of information
diffusion in this fully decentralized team. For LLMbased agents, we set the model temperature parameter to zero and perform three trials of repeated
measurement to ensure result stability. Each trial’s
duration varies from 5 to 120 minutes, depending
on task load and model selection.
5.2 Baselines
In addition to LLM-based embodied agents, we
also include baselines based on MARL and planning methods. For MARL, we consider MultiAgent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)
(Yu et al., 2022), which has shown strong performance in environments such as the StarCraft MultiAgent Challenge (SMAC) (Samvelyan et al., 2019).
Our model is based on a stateful actor-critic approach building on recurrent neural networks with
shared actor and critic models given agent invariance to improve sample efficiency and memory
requirements while avoiding the lazy agent problem (Sunehag et al., 2017). We utilise the default
hyperparameters for SMAC to train MAPPO in the
environment and evaluate its performance from another fixed distribution of randomly generated environments, recording the average score and episode
length as well as their standard deviation. Like
the LLM agents, MARL agents are able to observe

their teammates’ locations. Other than the team
reward of 10*x points when a x-phase bomb is
successfully defused, an additional intermediate reward term is implemented as well, where an agent
is given a small positive reward of +1 upon the
application of the correct wirecutter in defusing a
phase of a bomb and a small negative reward of −1
when it causes a bomb to explode upon the application of the wrong wirecutter. This reward-shaping
term allows the agents to more sample efficiently
learn the necessary bomb-defusing skills as compared to the relatively sparser team reward.
In addition, we augment a state-of-the-art MultiAgent Path-Finding (MAPF) algorithm, ConflictBased Search (CBS) (Sharon et al., 2015), simultaneously generate task assignments with feasible
and collision-free paths for agents that adhere to
precedence and temporal constraints in order to
maximise a user-defined objective instead of the
sum of path costs or makespan. Specifically, the
user-defined objective is quantified as the return
from a user-defined reward function, which is the
team reward of 10*x points when a x-phase bomb
is successfully defused in the stated task. The planner uses a user-defined heuristic (e.g. sort bombs
in ascending order of distance from the agents’
starting location) to sort the execution order of the
actions for the entire task. The ordered actions
are then partitioned using a hyperparameter, the
number of actions per subtask, to form a subtask
(e.g. the two nearest bombs to the agents’ starting
location). The actions from the subtask are used
to generate possible combinations of assignments
to agents. The planner returns a feasible solution
for the subtask by resolving precedence and temporal conflicts through the expansion of a binary
constraint tree in a best-first manner with respect to
the return. The solution for the entire task is then
composed of the solutions of the subtask sequen-

tially. By considering the entire task of 5 bombs as
a single subtask, the planner can be proven to be
complete and optimal with respect to the score.
5.3 Theory of mind inferences
Alongside the main task, LLM-based agents are
tasked with performing Theory of Mind (ToM) inferences during the mission. These inquiries fall
into three categories, aligning with three ToM capability levels. The first category, introspection,
assesses an agent’s ability to articulate its mental
state. The second category, first-order ToM inferences, tests if agents can estimate others’ hidden
mental states. The third category, second-order
ToM inferences, evaluates an agent’s ability to infer
what others believe about their own mental state.
The design principle of ToM questions is inspired by the Sally–Anne test, the most widely
used ToM task in human studies. Every time an
agent conducts an action, we pose a belief reasoning question, asking if another agent (i.e., target
agent) is aware of the potential consequence of this
action. The consequence here can be either a state
change (e.g., a bomb has been defused) or a belief change (e.g., Alpha has explored Room 5 and
found Bomb 3 in the room). An agent equipped
with ToM should realize that while they know the
consequence, the target agent might hold a false belief about it. A full list of ToM inference questions
can be found in appendix.
To evaluate whether LLM-based agents answer
these questions correctly, human annotators were
hired to provide subjective judgment based on fully
observable interaction and communication history.
Specifically, the following standard are considered:
1) if the target agent is present in the current room
and observes the consequence, 2) if the target agent
has been to this room before, 3) if the consequence
has been communicated to the target agent. It is
worth mentioning that high-order ToM inferences
involving communication are naturally ambiguous.
These corner cases were discussed among annotators to ensure a consistent standard across conditions.
6 Results
Table 1 and Table 2 present the main experiment results. This section will analyze each metric, examine potential reasons for performance differences,
and provide qualitative case studies of experimental
trials.

6.1 Task performance
Except for the ChatGPT team, all teams manage to
defuse all bombs within the time limit. Their efficiency is indicated by the average number of rounds
spent to complete the task. The CBS Planner resolves the task in 6.0 rounds, providing an optimal
baseline given its centralized coordination and perfect information sharing. MAPPO, a state-of-theart multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm,
completes the task in an average of 11.0 rounds
after 45 million timesteps of training, serving as a
practical baseline.
ChatGPT fails to complete the task in all experiments, averaging a team score of 43.3. On the
contrary, teams based on GPT-4 achieve full scores,
with those using explicit belief representations being more efficient (28.3 vs. 12.3 rounds). These
findings align with previous research demonstrating GPT-4’s superior reasoning capabilities compared to ChatGPT (Zheng et al., 2023). LLM-based
agents perform exceedingly well in team collaboration tasks, especially considering their fully zeroshot learning and decentralized framework. The incorporation of belief state representation improves
team collaboration by reducing invalid actions and
enhancing ToM inference capabilities.
6.2 Basic embodied interactions
For a successful team, each member should manage
individual sub-tasks effectively, a concept known
as taskwork in team science (Crawford and Lepine, 2013). This involves understanding task rules,
reasoning about action prerequisites and consequences, and interacting with the environment.
All LLM-based teams demonstrate basic embodied interaction capabilities, achieving better performance than the random baseline. Additionally,
LLM-based agents effectively express their beliefs
about task-related information via introspection, as
shown in Table 2. All agents show a strong performance (>80%) in understanding world knowledge
(e.g., bomb locations) and situation modeling (e.g.,
interaction history).
6.3 Emergent collaborative behaviors
To understand how LLM-based agents match the
performance of state-of-the-art MARL methods,
we analyzed team trajectories and conducted a qualitative analysis of emergent collaborative behaviors.
As shown in the top-right panel of Fig. 2, GPT4+Belief teams use communication messages to

coordinate tasks. Agent Alpha voluntarily takes
the role of a team leader, delegating sub-tasks to
other members. Other collaborative behaviors common in human teams (Fan and Yen, 2004), such
as helping, resolving conflicts, and sharing information, also emerge in LLM-based agent teams.
These findings suggest that LLMs, through learning
from massive language materials, acquire essential
teamwork skills without specific collaborative task
training.
6.4 LLM’s systematic failures
However, LLM-based agents’ collaboration is less
efficient than the optimal baseline. We identify
a few systematic failures that LLMs make during
team planning and discuss how they impede teamwork progress.

6.4.1 Long-horizon contexts
The first bottleneck of LLM-based teams’ efficiency is dealing with long-horizon contexts. During the mission, LLMs occasionally output invalid
actions that violate task rules, such as moving to
non-adjacent rooms or using tools they do not possess. Even though the information about room
connectivity and tool allocation are included in the
initial prompts and maintained in the inquiry text,
LLMs often overlook these details because they
are far away from the planning question at the end.
The more advanced GPT-4 model performs better
in considering long contexts and complex logic,
thereby making fewer invalid actions, as shown
in Table 1. Our proposed belief state is also helpful in this progress by re-emphasizing task related
information in the input prompt.

6.4.2 Hallucination
The second type of systematic failure we observe
in LLMs is their hallucination about the task state.
During the mission, agents might generate valid
but infeasible actions, like searching for a defused
bomb or claiming the sequence of a bomb without inspection. These actions stem from false beliefs about the game state and do not contribute
to task progress. We attribute these hallucinations
mainly to the lack of explicit belief representation.
Without access to complete interaction history and
only partial environment observations, LLM-based
agents can’t form an accurate belief about the task
state. Therefore LLMs might generate imaginations about nonexistent bombs or fake bomb sequences when reasoning about the next action. We
evaluate this hypothesis by the GPT-4+Belief condition where LLM-based agents explicitly represent
their belief state in text. Results show that the introduction of belief state decreases invalid action by
50.7% and increase the team efficiency by 130%
6.5 Theory of Mind Inference
A critical aspect of teamwork is inferring teammates’ mental states, including beliefs, desires, and
intentions. We assess LLM-based agents by asking
them to conduct Theory of Mind inferences during
the mission. As seen in Table 2, LLM-based agents
can estimate their own and their teammates’ mental states. In the most challenging second-order
ToM inference tasks, where agents estimate others’ beliefs about their own mental states, GPT-4
+ Belief agents correctly respond in nearly 70%
of cases. Consistent with team performance, GPT4 surpasses ChatGPT in all three ToM inference
levels, and explicit belief state representation enhances LLM-based agents’ ToM capabilities. In
the following case study, we’ll analyze LLM responses to see how they succeed or fail in certain
cases.
6.5.1 Case study
As shown in Fig. 2, after Alpha entered Room 5 and
observed the contents, we asked whether a teammate in another room (i.e., Charlie) knows Room
5’s contents. This is a first-order belief estimation
question. GPT-4 answers correctly saying
"No, Player Charlie does not know the
current contents of Room 5 since they
moved to Room 6. They are only aware

of the information they had before leaving Room 5."
considering both Charlie’s current location (not
in Room 5) and their interaction history (they’ve
been in Room 5 before). In contrast, ChatGPT fails
to consider this history. In the second-order ToM
inference case, we asked if Charlie is aware that
Alpha knows Room 5’s contents. GPT-4+Belief
answers correctly by considering previous communications whereas ChatGPT fails.
"Yes, player Charlie is aware that I know
the current contents of Room 5 because I
mentioned in my previous message that
I was moving to Room 5 to assist with
Bomb 3."
6.5.2 Inference under false belief
In some situations, ToM inferences become extremely challenging for LLMs. In our records, this
is typically when reasoning involves agent communication. Even with ample context, it’s hard
for agents to track information transmission while
conducting ToM inferences. The most demanding
scenarios occur when agents share inaccurate information, leading to false beliefs. This usually
happens when LLM-based agents try an invalid
action and broadcast false intentions through communication. For instance, when Alpha tells the
team they’re moving to Room 8 (which is unreachable), and we ask Alpha, "Is Charlie aware that
you know the contents of Room 8?" This question is tricky since Alpha failed to reach Room 8.
In theory, the most acceptable answer is complex
and involves multiple high-order ToM assumptions.
For example a human annotated ground truth is:
"I did not know the contents of Room
8 cause I failed to make it there. But
since I told Charlie I will go there, they
might assume that I know the contents of
Room 8. However, considering Charlie
knows my current location, they should
be able to tell that I am not able to move
to Room 5 and induce that I do not know
the contents of Room 5."
In practice, LLM-based agents often grasp only
part of the logic or miss the crucial fact that they
didn’t reach the target room. Quotes from GPT4+Belief agent:

"Based on the observation and previous
history, Player Charlie is not explicitly
aware that I know the current contents of
Room 8. However, since I mentioned in
my previous message that I was moving
to Room 8, Player Charlie might assume
that I would eventually learn about the
contents of Room 8."
7 Discussions
Our study yields three primary insights. First,
Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial planning and collaboration capabilities
within our task scenarios. With suitable promptengineering, teams of LLM-based agents perform
comparably to state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms. This finding is particularly noteworthy given that MARL
agents receive extensive task-specific training with
a centralized critic, while LLM-based agents operate in a fully decentralized manner and undertake
tasks in a zero-shot setting. Despite prior research
highlighting LLMs’ limitations in generating actionable plans and interacting with the world, they
perform reasonably well when placed in a team
and tasked to process actions step-by-step. Particularly, LLMs fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback demonstrate emergent
social interaction skills in multi-agent collaborations, which might be similar to the collaborative
and interactive settings in which human language
is primarily learned and used (Sap et al., 2023).
Second, LLMs still fall short of being optimal
planners or team players due to systematic failures, such as neglecting long-horizon contexts and
making inaccurate assumptions about the task state
(a.k.a hallucination). These flaws significantly hinder team collaborations as they can rapidly disseminate misinformation via communication, leading
to widespread false beliefs. We attempted to mitigate these issues by allowing LLM-based agents
to maintain an explicit belief state about the world.
Our findings suggest that modern LLMs can update the given belief descriptions based on their
observations, hinting at the potential emergence of
advanced cognitive skills such as world knowledge
understanding and situation modeling. Moreover,
belief state representations offer a structured framework that helps agents track key task-related information, leading to improved team performance.
Finally, our study indicates that the Theory of

Mind (ToM) capabilities of LLMs are still limited, particularly when evaluated within interactive
teamwork scenarios that involve dynamic belief
states and intensive communication. For context,
while 5-year-old children can perform second-order
ToM inferences (Miller, 2009), adults don’t consistently use this ability during communications due
to the complexity and ambiguity of social interactions (Keysar et al., 2003). Thus, there’s considerable work ahead for LLMs to develop a functional
ToM and interact naturally with humans. Our study
represents a preliminary effort to devise novel evaluation methods for LLMs’ ToM that go beyond
traditional tests such as the Sally-Anne test.
8 Conclusions
In this study, we assessed the ability of recent large
language models (LLMs) to conduct embodied
interactions in a team task. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based agents can handle complex
multi-agent collaborative tasks at a level comparable with the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
algorithm. We also observed evidence of emergent collaborative behaviors and high-order Theory of Mind capabilities among LLM-based agents.
These findings confirm the potential intelligence of
LLMs in formal reasoning, world knowledge, situation modeling and social interactions. Furthermore,
we discussed two systematic failures that limit the
performance of LLM-based agents and proposed
a prompt-engineering method that mitigates these
failures by incorporating an explicit belief state
about world knowledge into the model input.
Limitations
This study represents an initial effort to understand
machine intelligence in complex task scenarios.
Several enhancements could improve the experimental setup and offer a more thorough evaluation
of LLMs in multi-agent collaborations. First, we
could incorporate additional LLMs besides OpenAI’s GPT models. As new models emerge with
enhanced reasoning capabilities and larger input
sizes, their performance in team tasks and ToM
inference may also change. Second, the task environment is relatively simple with only five nodes
and five bombs. We plan to scale up the environment and introduce more restrictions to test how
LLM-based teams react to more challenging tasks.
Lastly, the current team consists of three agents
with homogeneous policies. It would be intrigu-

ing to evaluate how LLM-based agents perform
in human-agent teams, especially from a humancentered perspective where issues like trust, transparency, and human-agent co-training can be addressed.
The ToM capability evaluation method used in
this study also has its limitations. Currently, human
annotators, who have a global view of the task
state and interaction history, generate the ground
truth for ToM inference questions. However, this
estimation is at best an approximation, assuming
agents process information as a rational human
would, which might be ambiguous in situations
involving false beliefs or miscommunications. A
potential alternative could be using each agent’s
maintained belief state as the ground truth.
The proposed belief state method could extend
from introspective belief to first-order or even
second-order beliefs. Currently, LLM-based agents
maintain a belief state about their own world knowledge in text form. By extending this representation
to include other agents’ world knowledge, we could
equip LLM-based agents with an explicit first-order
ToM model. Their ToM capability can be assessed
by directly comparing one’s first-order belief with
another’s introspective belief, rather than asking
LLMs Sally-Anne style questions.

Appendix
A Prompts
A.1 Task context
Welcome to our interactive text game! In this game,
you’ll assume the role of a specialist on a search
and rescue team. Alongside two other players,
you’ll navigate a five-room environment with a
mission to defuse five hidden bombs.
The Map: Imagine a network of rooms represented by a connected graph where each node corresponds to a room, and the edges between nodes
depict hallways. The rooms are numbered 0, 3, 6,
5, and 8. Room 0 is connected to all other rooms.
Room 5 shares a hallway with room 6. Room 3 is
linked to room 8. And room 8 is also connected
with room 6. You can only travel to adjacent, directly connected rooms at each turn.
The Challenge: Scattered among these rooms
are five bombs, each coded with different phases
represented by colors. To defuse them, you’ll need
to use the correct wire-cutting tools in the correct
sequence. There are one-phase, two-phase, and
three-phase bombs, needing 1, 2, or 3 color-coded
tool applications in sequence to disarm. For instance, a bomb with a red-green phase sequence requires the red tool first, then the green one. Points
are awarded based on the number of tools used
for defusing a bomb, with each tool use worth 10
points. Your task is to maximize the team score as
soon as possible. The challenge is that the bomb
locations and sequences are unknown to players at
the start.
Tools: Each player is equipped with two colorcoded wire cutters. As player Alpha, you have red
and green tools, player Bravo wields green and
blue, and player Charlie possesses blue and red.
Actions: Each round, you can opt to do one of
the following: 1) Move to an adjacent room, 2)
Inspect a bomb’s phase sequence in your current
room, or 3) Apply your wire cutters to a bomb in
the current room.
Communications: In addition to selecting an
action to take from the above list, you can also
send communication message texts to both of your
teammates in each round. The message text you
sent will be shared with both of your teammates in
their observation in the next round.
Observation: While you can only see what’s
in your current room and read text messages from
teammates. You’ll also be informed of the current

round number, team score and the current location
of your teammates. Your teammates have the same
observability as you. They will not be able to know
your action and its consequences unless you explicitly communicate.
To facilitate our interaction, reply your action selection and communication messages in this fixed
format: Action selection: Your action. Message
to Team: “Your Message”. To move to an adjacent room, say: ’Move to Room X’. To inspect
the sequence of a bomb in your current room, say:
’Inspect Bomb’. To apply a wire cutter tool, say:
’Apply X Tool’. Remember, your replies must
adhere strictly to these rules. Feel free to ask clarifying questions if needed. I’ll supply the necessary
information as we progress. Are you ready to take
on this explosive challenge?
A.2 Initial belief state
Below is your current belief about game state based
on your previous observations about the environment and interactions with your teammates. Your
role: You are playing as Player <agent id>.
Current round: 1
Total team score: 0.
Observation: You are currently in Room 0 with
both of your teammates. In the room you also
found bomb 1 with unknown sequence. There is
no other bomb in the current room.
Teammate Locations: Player alpha is in Room
0; Player bravo is in Room 0; Player charlie is in
Room 0.
Room connectivity:
• Room 0 is connected to room 3, 5, 6, 8
• Room 3 is connected to room 0
• Room 5 is connected to room 0 and 6
• Room 8 is connected to room 0 and 6
Bomb Intel:
• Bomb 1: Located in Room 0. The phase sequence is Unknown.
• Bomb 2: Details currently unknown.
• Bomb 3: Details currently unknown.
• Bomb 4: Details currently unknown.
• Bomb 5: Details currently unknown.
Tool inventory:

• Alpha: Equipped with red and green wire cutters.
• Bravo: Equipped with green and blue wire
cutters.
• Charlie: Equipped with red and blue wire cutters.
Available action options:
• To move to an adjacent room, say: ’Move to
Room X’.
• To inspect the sequence of a bomb in your
current room, say: ’Inspect Bomb’.
• To apply a wire cutter tool, say: ’Apply X
Tool’.
• To send a message to your teammates, say:
’Message to Team: "Your Message"’.
B Environment feedback for Error
correction
• Your action is invalid.
• You can not directly move to Room roomid
because it is not adjacent to your current location, Room currentroom. Consider taking a
detour to another room first and then move to
your destination.
• There is no bomb in the current current location, Room currentroom, for you to inspect.
• You can not apply Tool toolcolor to Bomb
boomid because the sequence of this bomb is
sequence. You will need to apply other color
tool first.
• There is no bomb in your current location,
room roomid, for you to defuse.
• You do not have Tool toolcolor. Consider
asking your teammates who have this tool to
help you defuse the bomb.

• Do you know the current contents of room
roomid?
• Do you know the state and remaining sequence of bomb bombid has been changed?

• Does player playerid know the state and remaining sequence of bomb bombid has been
changed?
• Does player playerid know a bomb phase has
just been defused?

• Based on the observation and previous history, is player playerid aware of the fact that
you have changed the state and remaining sequence of bomb bombid?
• Based on the observation and previous history,

know a bomb phase has just been defused?
• Based on the observation and previous history,
is player playerid aware of the fact that you
know the sequence of bomb bombid?
