ABSTRACT
Current social simulation approaches face critical limitations in terms of the scale of agents, environmental
complexity, and behavioral reliability. This study presents a novel framework combining reinforcement learning
(RL) and large language models (LLM) to simulate community-level social dynamics with a large scale and the
fidelity. We construct a high-definition virtual replica of Yisheng Garden Community (in Unreal Engine),
populated with 3000 AI agents representing diverse demographic profiles derived from real community data.
Our dual-reward system integrates micro-level LLM evaluations of individual behavioral appropriateness with
macro-level statistical alignment to real smartphone usage patterns. The trained agents demonstrate remarkable
behavioral consistency with real residents across multiple validation metrics: smartphone usage patterns achieve
over 90 % correlation with real data throughout a week-long simulation, sleep patterns align with established
research findings across different demographic groups, and daily activity distributions well reflect authentic
social norms. Time-series analysis using Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models
confirms internal consistency between simulated and real behavioral data. This framework has well addressed
the problems about the agent scale limitation, environmental simplicity, and algorithmic bias that constrain
existing approaches. Our validated framework establishes a foundation for city-scale social simulation and
evidence-based social policy testing in virtual environments.
1. Introduction
Real world social experiment is one of the most challenging area in
computational social science. Traditional empirical studies face ethical
constraints, resource limitations, and the impossibility of controlled
experimentation on real-world communities ( Dunn et al., 2012 ).
Generative AI agent is emerging as a critical methodology for social
experiment and policy (interventions) test, which enables us to better
understand emergent social phenomena and social changes, in order to
achieve better social governance. In this direction, the Stanford Uni -
versity team created an AI town with the concept and architecture of AI
agents on April 13, 2023. They used the large language model (LLM) to
generate 25 AI agents, which primarily realizes the simulation of human
behavior with high reliability, thus showing realistic individual and
group behaviors in various interactive applications. These AI agents
have different personalities and can start spontaneous actions in the
virtual world, including getting up, sleeping, working and playing. They
can exchange information about daily life and the environment through
encounters and random dialogue. In this way, AI agents can recognize
the current environment and decide what to do next. In addition, AI
agents can also introspect, form new insights and make long-term plans
( Park et al., 2023 ). This work has primarily shown the potential of using
AI agents to simulate social interaction. Other than the AI town, there
also exist many other related researches. Zhao et al. designed the Lyfe
Agent utilizing the inferencing ability of LLM to simulate the process of
crime solving ( Zhao et al., n.d. ). Tang et al. proposed GenSim, a platform
simulating AI agents interacting on-line ( Tang et al., 2024 ). Zheng et al.
built AI Economist to simulate human economic activities in a simplified
environment ( Zheng et al., 2021 ).
After that, many studies have attempted to simulate human behavior
using large language models ( Aher et al., 2023 ; Gao et al., 2023 ; Park
et al., 2023 ). However, studies have shown that LLM may have value
biases, and it is challenging to ensure each generated behavior meets the
expected standards ( Tabone & De Winter, 2023 ). With the development

of computational social science, RL was more and more used to model
and analyze decision-making processes within complex, dynamic envi -
ronments ( Sutton, 2018 ). The core components of RL include an agent, a
set of actions, a state space representing the environment, a reward
signal, and the decision-making policy that the agent follows ( Ding
et al., 2020 ). The agent learns to make decisions by acting in an envi -
ronment to achieve cumulative rewards by RL ( Moussaoui & Ben -
slimane, 2023 ). By learning a value model and using the rewards
generated by the RL, it can be expected that the agent tend to behave
more human-like ( Al Nahian et al., 2024 ). However, there exist some
problems unsolved in the field of social simulation, and we are trying to
provide possible solutions to them:
(a) The scale remains the most obvious barrier . AI Town of
Stanford University has only 25 AI agents, Lyfe Agents only
supports simulation of 9 agents and there are only 10 AI Econo -
mists simulated in the platform of AI Economist. GenSim enables
a large number of agents but it has no visualizing method and has
the simplest virtual environment overall. In a real community,
people's behaviors and reactions are highly varied, but the
limited number of agents in AI Town restricts the diversity of
interactive scenes and modes for AI agents. This makes it quite
difficult to accurately represent real-world communities' complex
behaviors ( Hutson & Ratican, 2023 ). This scale mismatch pre -
vents researchers from studying the very social processes that
matter most for real-world applications. In our framework, we
provide simulation of 3000 AI agents which is larger than AI
town, Lyfe Agents, and AI Economist. Only GenSim supports
more agents than ours with the cost of simplest environment
among all the researches mentioned;
(b) Environmental authenticity presents the second constraint .
The AI Town of Stanford University uses simple pixel blocks
(patches) to model the community environment. Lyfe Agents uses
the graph engine Utility to build an animated 3d-world. GenSim
does not have a virtual physical environment and it shows the
simulation via a simple web interface. AI Economist constructs a
two-dimensional grid world for the agents to interact with. The
built environment influences social interactions, mobility pat -
terns, and daily routines. Without environmental fidelity,
behavioral realism becomes impossible to achieve or validate
against real-world data. Our framework, on the other hand,
construct the virtual environment exactly the same as a real
community. We use Unreal Engine to develop the virtual physical
world so that it can simulate the real interaction of the agents
with the physical world;
(c) Algorithmic reliability poses the deepest challenge . AI Town
of Stanford, Lyfe Agents, and GenSim all rely on LLM as the main
reasoning engine, while AI Economist solely deploy RL. The
complete reliance on LLM leads to potential inconsistencies in the
actions across different contexts. It is challenging for LLM to
ensure the behaviors generated each time meet expected stan -
dards and thus poses the risk of uncontrollability. Meanwhile,
standard RL is suitable for tasks in specific fields, like AI Econo -
mist did with economy, but it is difficult to design the reward
system for a much more general case, like human activities in
community. Pure LLM-based approaches suffer from inconsis -
tency, potential bias, and uncontrollable outputs that undermine
scientific reproducibility. The complete reliance on language
models leads to potential inconsistencies in actions across
different contexts, making it challenging to ensure behaviors
meet expected standards. Conversely, traditional RL frameworks
excel at optimization but struggle with the open-ended nature of
human social behavior. Neither approach alone can balance the
flexibility needed for realistic behavior with the control required
for scientific analysis. In order to solve the bias of algorithm, we
decide to combine the RL and LLM to avoid the uncontrollability
of LLM and take advantage of its general inferencing.
(d) ABM combined with RL þ LLM can be a possible solution .
ABM powered by RL and LLM are revolutionizing social simula -
tion. ABM framework based on the RL and LLM has achieved a
breakthrough, transitioning from simple task execution to com -
plex social behavior simulation by integrating the three core
components of planning, memory, and tool use. This enables AI
agents to exhibit human-like independent planning, collaborative
interaction, and creative behavior ( Park et al., 2025 ). ABM
powered by RL and LLM architectures successfully integrate
LLM/RL with ABM to create transformational frameworks for
understanding complex social systems. Through systematic
development of LLM-augmented social simulations, this archi -
tecture achieves unprecedented capabilities in modeling human
behavior and social dynamics. The integration delivers powerful
research toolsets that enable more nuanced, realistic, and
comprehensive representations of complex systems, revolution -
izing how researchers' study and predict social phenomena
through sophisticated computational approaches ( Gürcan, 2024 ).
For example, ABM with LLM systems have demonstrated the ca -
pabilities in simulating human-like behavior and replicating
human prosocial behavior in public goods games across multiple
experimental treatments. Beyond reproducing lab results, they
predicted responses to novel conditions and exhibited real-world
“ unbounded actions ” like collaboration and cheating ( Sreedhar
et al., 2025 ). LLM-powered ABM creates generative agents with
human-like cognitive, memory, and decision-making capabilities
that interact through natural language, enabling accessible and
interpretable social science research by simulating complex
public administration scenarios like crisis response without
requiring extensive technical expertise ( Xiao et al., 2023 ). It also
can create large-scale social simulators by constructing human-
like agents with cognition, emotions, and needs that interact in
realistic urban environments, enabling low-cost policy experi -
mentation and social phenomenon prediction through digital
twin societies that can simulate complex behaviors like opinion
polarization, crisis response, and economic dynamics ( Piao et al.,
2025 ).
Thus, we propose the RL + LLM framework. According to real GIS
and BIM data of the real community (named Yisheng Garden Commu -
nity), we construct a High-Definition 3D virtual community, as the
training environment of RL. According to real demographic data of this
community, we have generated 3000 AI agents. We design the obser -
vation capability and action spaces, to simulate 3000 AI agents living in
the virtual community. We design a reward system combining both
macro and micro level to guide action choices of AI agents. The micro-
level LLM reward is based on instant responses from LLM grading. It
provides the influence of large social laws on each individual AI agent.
The macro-level statistical reward is based on the comparison between
real data and simulations. It provides the behavioral pattern of group
(macro) level. For the real data, we use the smartphone usage data for
3000 real residents, and the data is updated by each 1/12 h (5 min).
Once the model is well trained, we generate community simulation of
one week and evaluate the performance based on comparison with real
data and social common senses. This study will address these constraints
through a novel integration (RL + LLM). By combining the consistency
of RL optimization with the behavioral sophistication of LLMs, we create
a framework that maintains both scientific rigor and behavioral
authenticity. Our approach scales to community-relevant populations
while grounding simulations in real demographic data and validating
outcomes against empirical behavioral patterns. The framework's
effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation of a real community
with comprehensive validation against multiple behavioral metrics,
ensuring that our contributions extend beyond algorithmic novelty to

practical utility for researchers, planners, and policymakers who require
evidence-based tools for understanding community dynamics at scale
( Table 1 ).
Key differentiators emerge from this comparison. While GenSim
achieves comparable agent numbers, it sacrifices environmental fidelity
and uses pure LLM control. AI Town and Lyfe Agents provide sophisti -
cated behavioral modeling but cannot scale beyond dozens of agents. AI
Economist demonstrates RL effectiveness but only in narrow economic
domains. Our framework uniquely combines large-scale capability with
environmental realism and algorithmic control, validated against real
community data rather than expert judgment. This combination ad -
dresses the fundamental limitations that prevent existing approaches
from supporting policy-relevant social simulation. With this proposed
framework, we can even achieve the simulation of the whole city by
integrating the simulations of all communities in the city. The results of
such city simulation are able to advise urban policy and planning, such
as traffic planning and garbage recycling. Our framework also supports
multiple fine-tuning methods to be adopted in other cities or countries.
2. Results
We deploy the trained model and generate the community simula -
tion of one week (7 days). It suggests that our framework (RL + LLM) can
yield outcomes that match real data very well, and the action patterns of
AI agents are quite close to real residents in this community, in terms of
social common sense.
2.1. Real data to align with
In order to verify the effectiveness of our simulation, we need to
compute and compare the similarities between virtual 3D community
and the real one ( Stonedahl et al., 2011 ). The smartphone usage data of
this community is obtained at group (macro) level, provided by the
Tencent Company who is one of the biggest Internet Company in China.
It provides popular mobile applications for Chinese people, such as
WeChat, QQ, Tencent Video, and Tencent Meeting. In China, there are
more than 1.2 billion people using the services and products provided by
Tencent Company. Therefore, smartphone usage data from Tencent
Company can largely reflect the real residents. In the rest of this paper,
we define the smartphone usage data gathered from Tencent Company
as the dataset of “ Real Phone Usage ” , and simulated phone usage in the
virtual community as the dataset of “ Simulated Phone Usage ” . The dif -
ference between two datasets is a key indicator to evaluate the matching
degree between the 3D virtual and real community behaviors. There also
exist rich amount of research about the sleep times and durations of
residents. In this section, we also compare the sleep pattern of AI agents
with real residents.
We understand that citizens in other countries present different
phone usage habits. For a country where smartphones are not involved
in daily life as much as China, other sources of data would be more
appropriate. Nevertheless, our proposed framework supports the
replacement of phone usage data with any kind of community-related
data while remaining effective.
2.2. Statistical consistency in the week scale
In the one-week simulation, we count the number of people using
smartphone inside the virtual community at each time step (t) and then
compare it with the Real Phone Usage. In our model, we assume the AI
agents use smartphone while they are reading, relaxing, shopping or
exercising. In Fig. 1 , the blue line shows the trends of Real Phone Usage
while the orange one represents the Simulated Phone Usage as we have
defined them in Section 2.1 . Both Real Phone Usage and Simulated
Phone Usage can well present synthetic periods of one day. Simulated
Phone Usage has seven peaks from Monday to Sunday (Monday 92.38
%, Tuesday 97.66 %, Wednesday 78.13 %, Thursday 94.53 %, Friday
88.67 %, Saturday 96.48 % and Sunday 91.80 %), which coincides with
seven peaks around similar times in the trend of Real Phone Usage. We
also compare the timing of peaks between the Real and Simulated Phone
Usage. As Fig. 1 shows, From Monday to Sunday, it reaches the peak at
21:15, 21:15, 20:20, 21:10, 21:25, 20:45 and 20:40 for Real Phone
Usage, while it also takes the maximum at 22:10, 21:30, 22:10, 22:10,
22:00, 23:00, and 21:40 for the Simulated Phone Usage. The differences
in peaks' timing are less than 1 h. There are also 7 concaves in the Real
Phone Usage (Monday 6.52 %, Tuesday 6.46 %, Wednesday 6.57 %,
Thursday 5.62 %, Friday 5.33 %, Saturday 8.25 %, Sunday 8.17 %)
while the Simulated Phone Usage takes its minimum at the similar times
(Monday 8.40 %, Tuesday 7.42 %, Wednesday 9.37 %, Thursday 8.40 %,
Friday 7.81 %, Saturday 7.23 %, Sunday 10.74 %). Therefore, the
overall statistical outcome suggests that the smartphone usage of the
virtual community simulated by the model matches with Real Phone
Usage well.
2.3. Statistical consistency in the daily scale
Fig. 2 shows the trends and basic statistical information of both Real
Phone Usage and Simulated Phone Usage in each day for a week. Sub -
plots A-G represent the comparison between the Real Phone Usage and
the Simulated Phone Usage. In these subplots, blue lines represent Real
Phone Usage, and orange lines represent Simulated Phone Usage.
Table H of Fig. 2 shows the mean and SD for Real and Simulated Phone
Usage for each day. Like the observation made in the scale of one week,
the daily result suggests that the trend of Simulated Phone Usage in each
day is also consistent with the daily trend of Real Phone Usage. Fig. 2 A
represents the Real and Simulated Phone Usage on Monday. The blue
line represents Real Phone Usage, and it shows that the phone usage
continues to decline (78.55 % – 9.65 %) between 0: 00 and 6: 00. After 6:
00, it begins to rise slowly until 8: 00. Then, the usage of smartphones is
overall stabilized and shows a gradual upward trend until 18:00 when it
begins to rise rapidly again. Real Phone Usage reaches the peak (100 %)
at 21:15 and then declines immediately. The orange line representing
Simulated Phone Usage shares the exact same pattern as the Real Phone
Usage through the whole day in the perspective of both critical points
and extreme values. The statistical information also shows trivial dif -
ference in each day. The difference in mean value takes its minimum of
0.02 on Saturday and the difference in standard deviation (SD) takes its
minimum of 0.002 on Sunday as it shows in Fig. 2 H.

2.4. Inner consistency for two datasets
Other than statistical analysis, we also apply machine learning (ML)
to prove (recheck) the well matchiness between Real Phone Usage and
Simulated Phone Usage. We use time series analysis to validate the unity
of trends and periods. Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving
Average (SARIMA) is broadly used model, in the field of broadcasting
features highly related to the time. It is made of two parts, seasonal and
non-seasonal, and each part combines differencing with autoregression
and a moving average model. For seasonal parameters and non-seasonal
parameters, we set two sets. In each set, there are three major param -
eters: p stands for the order of the autoregressive part; d stands for the
degree of first differencing involved; q stands for the order of the moving
average part ( Sinuany-Stern, 2021 ). We divide the Real Phone Usage
dataset into two parts, Monday to Thursday (training set) and Friday to
Sunday (validation set).
We have run multiple experiments and found out the optimal pa -
rameters for both sets, such as ( p ¼ 1 , d ¼ 0 , q ¼ 1 ) for seasonal parts
and ( p ¼ 1 , d ¼ 0 , q ¼ 1 ) for non-seasonal part. For Real Phone Usage
data, Fig. 3 A shows the target and predicted trend from Friday to Sunday
by the SARIMA model, with 95 % confidence interval (CI). The red line
represents the Real Phone Usage trend. The blue dots are the predicted
values from Friday to Sunday. The shaded band represents the CI range.
All predicted points (values) fall into the 95 % CI, and our SARIMA
model can predict the smartphone usage of real residents, which in -
dicates that real data has inner consistency at the week scale.
For Simulated Phone Usage, we apply the same SARIMA model with
the same parameter values, to check the inner consistency at the same
time scale (week). We divide the Simulated Phone Usage into two sets,
such as the training set (Monday to Thursday) and validation set (Friday

to Sunday). Like Fig. 3 A, Fig. 3 B shows the target trends, predicted value
points, and 95 % CI range. Most predicted points are included in the 95
% CI, which indicates that the same SARIMA model can predict simu -
lated smartphone usage behaviors of AI agents. Therefore, for either
Real or Simulated Phone Usage, the validation set can be well predicted
by the training set. Hence, the outcome of our simulation can largely
reflect the inner consistency of real-world social actions of real residents.
2.5. Performance evaluation metrics
In this paper, we bring up 4 metrics to evaluate the performance of
simulation. In order to evaluate, we smooth the real data simulated data
by taking the hourly summation and evaluate the performance based on
these smoothed data ( Table 2 ).
Structural image similarity (SSIM) index is one of the most popular
measurements for the similarity between images. It evaluates lumi -
nance, contrast, and structure of two compared images in the set of
corresponding windows around image pixels ( Starovoytov et al., 2020 ).
In our research, we construct two images – “ real image ” and “ simulated
image ” using smoothed real data and simulated data. We first reshape
the smoothed data into arrays with 24 rows and 7 columns representing
24 h and 7 days. We multiply the values inside the arrays by 255 to
transform them into standard form of images. Then, we compute the
SSIM index for these two images. The value of SSIM index represents the
similarity in absolute value, trends within days and trends through the
whole week between real and simulated phone usage. The range of SSIM
index is between 0 and 1, and our simulation achieved an outstanding
score as 0.79.
Fourier Transform (FT) is a mathematical operation that decomposes
a time-domain signal into its constituent frequency components,
revealing both amplitude and phase information across the frequency
spectrum ( Bracewell, 1989 ). In this paper, FT was applied to detect
timing discrepancies between real and simulated data, leveraging its
ability to decouple overlapping periodic behaviors. We compute the
phase difference between the real and simulated data under two main
frequencies: one-day and half-day. The phase difference is   1.48 h
under the frequency of one day and   0.06 h under the frequency of half
day. If we assume the period of phone usage is one day, then the apex of
simulated phone usage is 1.48 h earlier than the real ones. Likewise, if
we assume the period of phone usage is half a day, then the apex of
simulated phone usage is only 0.06 h earlier than the real ones.
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence) is a non-symmetric
measure quantifying the difference between two probability distribu -
tions ( Biglieri, 2022 ). The divergence of distribution P from distribution
Q is computed as D
KL
(
P ∣ | Q ) =
∑
P ( x ) log
P ( x )
Q ( x )
. In our research, we
normalize the real and simulated data to convert them into the form of
distribution. Their value can be then considered as the probability of
using mobile phone at a certain timestep. This approach and metric is
suitable for assessing distributional alignment in phone usage data
because it focuses on relative entropy rather than absolute values. The
value of KL-Divergence of the simulated data from the real data is 0.071.
The range of KL-Divergence is from zero to infinity and value below 0.1
is an indication of similar distribution in the field of statistics. The value
0.071 indicates that the simulated data only has minor deviation from
the real data.
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a robust algorithm designed to
measure similarity between two temporal sequences that may vary in
speed or length, by computing an optimal alignment path that mini -
mizes the cumulative distance between them through nonlinear warping
of the time axis ( Müller, 2007 ). The optimal warping path identified in
the analysis of real versus simulated data signifies the sequence of point-
to-point matches that minimizes the total cumulative distance between
these two temporal sequences. After we compute the optimal wrapping
path, we let the time indices of real data in the point-to-point matches be
the independent variable (x) and the time indices of simulated data as
dependent variable (y). If the linear equation y = x can fit the point-to-

point matches well, we can conclude that these two temporal sequences
are quite similar. We calculate the predicted values using the equation y
= x and then compute R2. The value of R2 is 0.99, which means the
optimal path is very close to the equation y = x, thus indicating the real
data and simulated data are very similar. We visualize the pairs of time
indices and the desired regression line with 10 units y-intercept shifted
region in Fig. 4 . All the points fall inside the shifted region, which in -
dicates that all the pairs of time indices have difference less than 10
units.
Overall, we evaluate the performance of simulation with four
different metrics. SSIM evaluate the structural similarity between the
real and simulated data, FT enables us to measure the phase shift of
simulated data from real data, KL-Divergence evaluate the simulation by
transforming the data into the form of distribution and DTW yields an
optimal wrapping path that indicates the similarity between real and
simulated data. With all of the four metrics, the simulation of the phone
usage can be evaluated as sound and valid.
2.6. Matched sleep patterns for weekdays and weekends
Fig. 5 A shows the number of AI agents sleeping at each timestep
through a weekday. AI agents go to bed and wake up at different timings,
but during the same time interval, which is close to real people. The
number of AI agents sleeping starts relatively high at 0:00 and it in -
creases for approximately 5 h. Then it drops rapidly between 6:00 and
8:00, indicating that most AI agents get up during this period. This
pattern matches social natural norms of real residents. The number stays
low during the daytime and begins to increase after 20:00. The gradual
rising from22:00 to midnight indicates that most people go to bed in this
time interval. The line continues going up smoothly after 0:00, indi -
cating some people staying up late at night and therefore, go to bed at
various times.
Besides the start time of the sleep, we also investigate the sleep
duration of AI agents in the same day and compare it with existing
research, to further verify the effectiveness of our simulation. Fig. 5 B & C
show the distributions of sleeping duration in a weekday and on
weekends. Fig. 5 D & E show the difference in sleep duration distribution
among different life stage groups. As Fig. 5 B shows, 52.78 % of AI agents
sleep 7 – 10 h at weekday. Researchers conducted questionnaire surveys
at the Boston Science Museum from February to May 2009, distributing
48-question surveys to adult visitors that included the Horne-
¨
Ostberg
MEQ, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness
Scale (ESS), the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, as well as 12 addi -
tional questions addressing general sleep habits. Results showed most
participants reported approximately 7.55 ± 1.22 h of weekday sleep
( Roepke & Duffy, 2010 ), which is consistent with our study. Only 22.62
% of them sleeping for more than 10 h during the weekdays. Through
large-scale cohort studies and objective measurement technologies,
including wearable devices (such as Fitbit), activity recorders, stan -
dardized questionnaires, and systematic reviews with meta-analysis,
scientists analyzed 50 million nights of sleep data from 73,513 partici -
pants in the British Biobank study, 38,015 participants in the Swedish
national cohort study, and more than 220,000 total participants. The
research found that participants slept more than 10 h on weekends,
which also matches the empirical finding that some people sleeping for
more than 10 h ( Gallicchio & Kalesan, 2009 ).
Existing research indicates that sleep duration shows significant
differences between weekdays and weekends. During the weekdays,
people who accumulate considerable sleep debt compensate on week -
end by lengthening their sleep by several hours ( Roenneberg et al.,
2003 ). Fig. 5 C & E represent the sleep pattern of AI agents during the
weekend. The values of sleep duration in these two subplots stand for the
average of Saturday and Sunday. We found that during weekdays,
considerable amount of AI agents sleep less than 6 h, and most AI agents
(20.24 %) sleep for 8 – 9 h. However, Fig. 5 C indicates no AI agents sleep
less than 6 h, and most of them (26.19 %) sleep for 11 – 12 h in average
and retired seniors sleep for 6.50 h in average during the weekday. This
sleep pattern differences fit with the previous research that seniors tend

and corresponding regression performance. We let the time indices of real data in the point-to-point matches be the independent variable (x) and the
time indices of simulated data as dependent variable (y). We test if the line y = x is an appropriate regression for the data points. The blue dots in this figure represent
the pairs of indices and the pink line represents the regression line y = x. The shaded area represents the shift with 10 units of y intercepts. (For interpretation of the

to sleep for less time than students and adults ( Hirshkowitz et al., 2015 ).
For the weekend, Fig. 5 E shows that unemployed adults and retired
seniors sleep for 4 to 5 h, while the employed adults and students sleep
for 8 to 9 h in the simulation. For our simulation of all life stage groups,
AI agents sleep more during weekdays than during weekdays but
employed adults and students still sleep for more hours than unem -
ployed adults and retired seniors. This pattern can be explained and can
reflect the behaviors of real residents. As employed people and students
sleep less on weekdays, they tend to sleep more on the weekends.
2.7. Simulations supported by social common senses
Fig. 6 A shows the trend (number) of AI agents doing each activity
through a weekday (we take Monday as example). Based on this, we
compare the action patterns of two groups (employed adults and stu -
dents) by the difference in action curves (working and studying). The
trends of working and studying fit the observations of these actions in
real community well. These two actions (working and studying) both
rise rapidly in the morning, stay unchanged for the daytime, and then
fall in the afternoon. The difference is that the curve for working starts to
rise earlier than studying, and it declines later than studying. It also
shows that the curve for working grows and drops more smoothly. In
real society, people's day shifts start at various timings. Some start their
work at 7:00, while some others start at 10:00 ( Soldatos et al., 2005 ).
Respectively, some people's shifts end at 16:00 while some others end at
20:00. For students, the period of school time is much more regular and
stable. Most of the schools start and end at similar times, therefore
students tend to start and end the action of studying at similar times

( Kelley et al., 2017 ). Therefore, the curves of these two simulated ac -
tions can largely reflect the social common sense that also affects real
residents.
We then focus on the difference among four typical life stage groups
to further check whether simulated behaviors of AI agents can be vali -
dated by social laws and regulations (social common sense). Fig. 6 B, C,
D & E represent the trend (number) of AI agents in each Life Stage doing
each activity through the same week day. Generally, in the society,
students and employed adults leave home for school or work in the
morning and return home in the evening, showing strict regularities in
their daytime schedules, which can be reflected by the stable and flat
surface found in the curves of studying and working. However, most
students would go to a school near home, while most of the employed
adults have to endure commuting time over 30 min ( Koslowsky et al.,
2013 ), which leads to the timing difference in commuting. This pattern
difference can be reflected by comparing the curve slopes of employed
adults in Fig. 6 B and students in Fig. 6 C. It suggests that the curve slope
of employed adults is much shallower than the students. The steeper
slope for the students indicates that they would spend less commuting
time than employed adults. Hence, the action pattern of AI agents
(employed adults and students) can be largely supported by social
common sense. The verification from social common sense can be also
found in the other two groups. For the retired seniors, existing research
shows that they tend to exercise inside the community while unem -
ployed adults tend to go shopping during the daytime and they would
take these actions casually ( Simek et al., 2015 ). Fig. 6 D & E show the
trends (numbers) of AI agents (unemployed adults and retired seniors)
taking each action during a weekday. The curve of AI agents (retired
seniors) exercising and the curve of AI agents (unemployed adults)
shopping both grow in the morning, reach the peak in the noon, and
start to drop in the afternoon. The AI agents (retired seniors) start to
exercise at different times in the morning, during 6:00 and 12:00. The
number of AI agents (retired seniors) exercising takes its maximum at
12:00. This maximum stays for an hour and then it keeps decreasing in
the afternoon, indicating that they return home at various times in the
afternoon. This action pattern of AI agents (retired seniors) is consistent
with the real-world retired seniors that they tend to exercise inside the
community during the daytime.
AI agents of unemployed adults start to go shopping at different
times in the morning from 10:00 to 12:00. The number of them shopping
takes its maximum at 13:00 and then decreases gradually in the after -
noon, indicating they return home at various times. This action pattern
of AI agents (unemployed adults) is consistent with real-world unem -
ployed adults in this community that they tend to go shopping during
the daytime (because they do not have to work). Generally, in real so -
ciety, unemployed adults and retired seniors are free from strict daily
working schedules and take their actions more casually than students
and employed adults. By our simulation, the curves for trends (numbers)
of them exercising and shopping have narrow peaks at their maximums,
unlike the stable surfaces presented by the curves of employed adults
and students in Fig. 6 B & C. This indicates that the AI agents of retired
seniors and unemployed adults follow less strict daily routine than

unemployed adults.
P. Lu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cities 168 (2026) 106468

students and employed adults, which is consistent with real-world pat -
terns of retired seniors and unemployed adults. Hence, the simulation of
AI agents (retired seniors and unemployed adults) can be largely sup -
ported by the social common sense.
Fig. 6 illustrates the crowd behavior from the perspective of actions,
and Fig. 7 provides another independent proof source, by investigating
typical locations of them at various timings for the same weekday as
Figs. 5 & 6 . Fig. 7 presents the location dynamics (distribution) of AI
agents through a weekday. The curve of AI agents located at working
place has the same shape of AI agents (employed adults) working in
Fig. 6 A. Similarly, the curve of AI agents located at school in Fig. 7 A has
the same shape of related AI agents (students) studying in Fig. 6 A. This
pattern consistent reflects social common senses that only students
would go to school and employed adults go to workplaces (In our
framework, we mark the school as working place for adults who works
there). The curve of AI agents located at community public area in
Fig. 7 A has the same shape of AI agents (retired seniors) exercising in
Fig. 6 D, and the curve of AI agents located at shops in Fig. 7 A has the
same shape of AI agents (unemployed adults) shopping in Fig. 6 E. These
shared patterns can also be supported by social regulations in China that
retired seniors would exercise in public area inside the community while
the unemployed adults tend to go shopping nearby during the daytime.
Fig. 7 B, C & D provide the location distribution of AI agents at three
different timings. At 8:00, most AI agents are still at home, some
(employed adults and students) are already located in their working
places or schools, and there is no AI agent located in the community
public area or shops in Fig. 7 B. Obviously, this pattern satisfies real-
world social common sense in China that, in the morning, most stu -
dents and employed adults would leave home earlier than unemployed
adults or retired seniors. At 14:00, the AI agents are located more evenly
in Fig. 7 C. Most AI agents located in working place, which reflects the
social fact worldwide that employed adults take the majority proportion
in the society. At 19:00, most AI agents are located at home, but there
are still some AI agents located at working places in Fig. 7 D. This is also
consistent with real social phenomenon in China that some employed
adults would end their shifts later in the night and return home quite
later than others. Hence, the location dynamics of AI agents can be
largely supported by related social phenomena, social regulations and
social common sense in China or worldwide.
3. Discussion
In this paper, we have proposed a combined social simulation
framework of AI agents, which has been applied to simulate the social
actions of residents in the community level society. We have found that
this framework is effective in community-level social simulation. The
combined design of dual rewards in both micro-level and macro-level
has also shown effectiveness for the training process. The macro-level
statistical rewards are gained based on the difference between Real
and Simulated Phone Usage, and the consistency between two datasets
can validate the reasonability and effectiveness of macro-level statistical
reward. The micro-level LLM reward is calculated based on the grades of
LLM. It rates the normality degree of social actions for individual AI
agents. In other words, the grade of LLM can train them to take appro -
priate (normal) actions at different times. The matched behavior pat -
terns between AI agents and real residents suggest that the micro-level
LLM reward also largely supports our social simulation. Overall, our
framework adopts mature and robust training methodology (RL) and it
has been proven to be valid. It successfully trained a feasible and flexible
policy via the comprehensive reward system containing two layers such
as the macro-level (statistical data) and micro-level (LLM grading).
This social simulation framework yields promising results, and most
of them are close to real social system. Simulated Phone Usage (simu -
lation results) is consistent with Real Phone Usage (real community level
data). The inner consistency between them has also been proved by the
ML method (time series analysis). The sleep patterns of AI agents agree
with previous social research, for different life stage groups and for
different timing (weekdays and weekends). The trends (numbers) of AI
agents taking each action are well supported by the social common
senses and the behavioral patterns of the 4 different life stage groups are
well matched with real residents. The dynamical location distributions
of AI agents share same patterns as real resident actions. This consis -
tency is also supported by the social laws and regularities in China or
worldwide.
In our research, we found general community rules by investigating
the action and location history records and all of these records are open

timings: 8:00, 14:00 and 19:00.
P. Lu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cities 168 (2026) 106468

sourced to all scholars. These community rules can be further validated
by scholars from other perspectives using data from other sources. For
example, social organizations may be interested in the action histories of
the elders. If they already gathered such data from real elders, our
community rule about elders' action patterns can be further validated by
them. We also look forward to new interpretations of our results from
other filed of studies. For example, social activists may be interested in
the number of people gathered in the public area inside the community.
In this case, the location history record can provide the accurate data for
them. Economists may be interested in the population flow through
different gates of the community. The action history records the exact
gate agents go through when going out or into the community. The
accurate population flow through all directions can thus be computed.
Our framework also provides considerable portability to be per -
formed in different cities. The most resource expensive way is to train an
entirely new model based on different cities and citizens. The second
way is to fine tune the base model we already have using the data of new
cities and citizens, which is a more economical method. The most
resource friendly way is to adjust action masks in the configuration file
representing specific rules or legislation of different countries or cities.
By either method, our framework is able to achieve valid community
simulation.
In the future, we will construct a city simulation system based on our
proposed community simulation framework. Modern city is a complex
system composed of communities; therefore, city simulation can be
made by integrating the simulation of multiple communities. The results
of such city simulation can be used for urban policy and planning. Traffic
planning is an important work of urban governance. With our simulation
framework, we are able to simulate the commuting destination and
commuting method of each resident in each community, providing
valuable reference for traffic planning of a city. Other than traffic
planning, public resource distribution has also been a delicate and
important task for urban governance. Once we build valid simulations
for all the communities in the city, we are able to observe the difference
in the needs of various resources among communities. For example, our
simulation framework can provide information to infer the amounts of
different types of garbage produced in each community. Decision maker
of the city can adjust the resource for garbage recycling instructed by
this simulation result.
Although the current framework can well simulate residents' be -
haviors in specific community, we need to point out potential limitations
and future improvements. The first is the variance of environment and
actions. We have not constructed nearby environment of the commu -
nity, such as the spaces like schools and companies. And we have not
constructed the visualization for the actions in these spaces yet. In the
future, we plan to expand the environment with more buildings and
more complicated spaces, to enlarge our action space so that the AI
agents can take more detailed actions such as sporting and napping. The
second limitation is the lack of AI agents' inner motivation. Our frame -
work now only simulates physical behaviors, which is not enough. The
motivations of AI agents should be included. Peng et al. claim that
evaluation of AGI should be rooted in dynamic embodied physical and
social interactions ( Peng et al., 2024 ), hence the construction of physical
and emotional needs is necessary. In the future, we will introduce the
element of motivations when we design the action policy model for AI
agents to choose so that their behavior would also reflect how the
motivation drives the actions of real residents. The third limitation is the
portability of algorithm. The environment we built now is based on one
specific community in Wuhan. We have not verified if the algorithm we
developed is also applicable for other communities. In the future, we
would deploy the same framework for other communities to verify the
portability of our algorithm.
4. Materials and methods
4.1. Constructing high-definition virtual community
We initiate the modeling of movement within a specified community
region using virtual simulations. This virtual modeling is accomplished
with Unreal Engine (UE), which is a software development tool designed
for creating interactive applications, which includes components such as
a graphics engine, animation tools, physics engine, sound engine, and
scripting capabilities. It is a versatile tool in the field of video games.
Many famous games like PUBG, FIFA and Black Myth Wukong are built
with it. With the support of UE, we can visualize the virtual community
vividly.
Fig. 8 shows the details of virtual community (Yisheng Garden
Community). Consisting of 1848 households, it is an accommodation-
business mixed complex and is located at Wuhan City in China. Fig. 7 J
& K show the real GPS image of this real community and the upper view
for the virtual community we constructed. All the buildings and path -
ways in the real community are included in this virtual community. As it
shows in Fig. 8 A & C, we construct the virtual main entrances situated
between Buildings 3 and 6 on the eastern side and between Buildings 7
and 11 on the southern side with all the details matched with the real
community. These entrances are decorated by tall, orderly placed tree
arrays, pedestrian pathways, and recreational green plazas. In total,
38.15 % of the community is covered by green land, enhancing the
urban streetscape and creating a warm and vibrant community
atmosphere.
Other than the main buildings and public area, we also model high-
resolution details inside the buildings as shown in Fig. 8 G & H & I. Our
community-level social simulator provides users all the details of the
resident in the community from bargains in the markets to evening
walks in the park. Users can explore every corner of this virtual com -
munity, keeping track of any resident of interest via a friendly interface.
4.2. Generative modeling of AI agents
Under real-world limitations, we cannot obtain detailed information
(data) of individuals or residents in the community, which hinders the
development of traditional social research. However, we can largely
simulate real-world people using generative AI agents. Based on group-
level features of the real residents, we generate following features for AI
agents: Gender, Age, Marital Status, Educational Level, Life Stage, Car
Ownership, Commuting Distance, Commuting Methods, Career, Routine
Action, Action Time, and Go Home Time.
Table 3 shows the list of group features that we have collected from
social surveys in this community. The features of Gender, Age and
Commuting Method are generated independently with the ratio pre -
sented in Table 3 . The distribution of marital status in Table 3 indicates
the married/single ratio among the eligible populations, which is
composed of male no younger than 22 years old and female no younger
than 20 years old (according to Civil Code of the People's Republic of
China). Thus, we mark all the ineligible agents as single and then
generate the Marital Status for the remaining individuals according to
the distribution. We apply similar approaches to generate other features.
There exist age bounds for each level of education. Residents need to be
at least 12 years old to graduate from primary schools, at least 15 years
old to finish middle school, at least 18 years old to graduate from high
schools and at least 22 years old to graduate from colleges. Thus, we set
the potential Educational Level for the agents according to their ages
and then allocate the value according to the distribution. The law reg -
ulates that people under 18 years old are not allowed to drive, so we
mark all the ineligible agents as “No” for the feature of Car Ownership;
the feature of the Life Stage is bounded by the value of Age and Gender
as only male older than 60 or female older than 55 could be retired and
only agents older than 18 could be employed/unemployed adults; the
feature of the Commuting Duration is dependent on the Age and Life

Stage since retired agents and agents under 3 years old does not need to
commute regularly. Besides, the feature Career for AI agents is generated
from the statistical data collected in the Seventh National Census in
2021. The specific proportion is listed in Table 4 .
Routine Action is the feature representing the daily action taken by
the agent. It usually starts in the morning and is decided by the agent's
Life Stage. In the real society, students spend most of their time studying
and employed adults spend most time working. Thus, we assign “ Go to
School ” and “ Go to Workplace ” for the agents of these two life stages.
Unemployed adults and retired seniors, on the other hand, do not follow
strict daily routine like students and employed adults. Therefore, we
assign None to Routine Action of agents experiencing these two life
stages.
The feature Action Time indicates the usual time of Routine Action.
For students, we assume the start time of first class is normally distrib -
uted. According to previous social surveys, the mean value of start time
is 7:35 and the standard deviation (SD) is 30 min ( Karan et al., 2021 ).
We draw the start time from this distribution and subtract
Commuting Duration from it to generate Action Time. For the employed
adults, we set the Action Time as 9:00 subtracted by the agent's
Commuting Duration.
According to the data from Wuhan Municipal Education Bureau, the
Class Release Time for primary school students is 16:30, and 17:30 for
middle school students. The feature of Go Home Time for students is set
the same as the Class Release Time. For employed adults, we draw the
value of the working duration from the normal distribution N

and add it to the timing of going to work to generate the Go Home Time
for employed agents.
4.3. Reinforcement learning algorithm
In a general RL framework, there exist an environment and agents
can interact with the environment including other agents. We define the
set of environment and agent as state space, which is denoted as S . Then,
we define the action space set containing all possible actions for agents,
denoted as A . After an action is taken, the state will somehow change.
We define the reward from s to s ′ under action a as R
a
( s , s
ʹ
) . At time step
t, the agent observes the state S
t
and receive the reward R
t
. Then, it takes
the action A
t
and interact with the environment. The environment
moves to a new state S
t + 1
, and then presents S
t þ 1
and R
t þ 1
to the agent,
at next time step (t + 1). In this process, our goal is to find the relation,
called policy function π : S × A → [ 0 , 1 ] , which represents the probability

of each action under a specific state, in order to maximize the long-term
return defined in Eq. (1) ( Sutton, 2018 ). Furthermore, the expected
long-term return at the state s with the policy π is given by the Bellman
Equation in Eq. (2) . At state s , we would also want to know whether a
specific action a would yield better return than other actions on average,
under the policy π . This difference is defined by Advantage Function as
shown in Eq. (3) .

Mnih et al. (2015) introduced neural network to represent the policy
function and successfully trained the agent to play video games properly
( Mnih et al., 2015 ). It decides the agent's action and is then called policy
network and the reward of each time step (t) is used for the training
( Fig. 9 ). There are multiple state-of-the-art methods to optimize the
policy network, and we decide to implement Proximal Policy Optimi -
zation Algorithms (PPO). The main reason is that agents we created can
be considered as players whose goal is to achieve the highest rate in
“ behaving normal ” and PPO can achieve promising performance for
various games ( Yu et al., 2022 ). It constructs the surrogate loss for the
policy network that restricts the update in a certain level and encourages
the increase of entropy ( Schulman et al., 2017 ).
4.4. The application and improvement of LLM
As large language model shows the potential to simulate human
actions, we apply it to our RL framework. In earlier times, the language
models are often small and aimed to do specific finite tasks. Then,
Google researchers (2017 NeurIPS conference) introduced the trans -
former architecture in their landmark paper “ Attention Is All You Need ”
( Vaswani, 2017 ). This architecture eventually became a milestone for
the technology of language models. The models inspired by the trans -
former architecture could have enormous number of parameters, which
brought up the concept of “ Large ” Language Model (LLM). By the time of
September 2024, the most famous and probably the most powerful LLM
is the model o1 published by OpenAI ( Wang et al., 2024 ). It achieves to
establish the long-term thinking ability for the model and can beat
human experts in various academic competence. Despite the capability
of o1, OpenAI does not provide the source code for users to set up
locally. On the other hand, there also exist some other models available

for download and customization such as Gemma and LLaMA. They are
both leading models according to the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leader -
board ( Dunlap et al., 2024 ).
Before we decided to introduce LLM in the reward system, we had
already trained the policy model purely using the phone usage data. We
recorded the action history for all the agents and found out that the AI
agents failed to show any tendency to relocate themselves. For instance,
the number of AI agents in their homes declines dramatically in the early
morning but stays stable for the rest of whole day. We believe this sit -
uation is due to the lack of reward source. The reward is only related to
the phone usage inside the community. Thus, the change of location
would not help or undermine the achievement of reward. To simulate
the location dynamics or more detailed actions other than those
involved with phone usage, another source of reward is needed. We
introduce another source of reward given by LLM regarding AI agents'
action history. We present some examples of prompts and responses in
Fig. 8 . Double sources of reward make sure of the simulation of phone
usage, as well as location dynamics and detailed actions.
In order to find the suitable LLM for the task of grading agents' ac -
tions, we construct a dataset from human responses. We generate 2123
prompts asking if the action history regarding and ask human volunteers
to answer them. In this way, we collect 2123 “ prompt-response ” pairs as
a fine-tuning dataset. We split the dataset into training set and testing set
with the ratio 8:2. As it shows in Table 5 , we first evaluate some open
source LLMs and evaluate their performances with the average differ -
ence between the grades they generate and the grades given by humans.
Then, we use the training set to fine tune the model “ llama3.1_8b_chi -
nese_chat_q4_k_m ” . We choose this model because it has the best original
performance among the LLMs we tried. As it shows in Table 5 , the fine-
tuned model achieves a low average difference as 11.35, which largely
outperformed all original LLMs we selected. Thus, we use this fine-tuned
model to generate grade for agents' actions.
4.5. The combined framework of RL and LLM
Fig. 10 shows the combined framework of RL and LLM we build. We
construct the RL framework with five major parts: Agent, Environment,
Observation, Action, and Reward. We first initialize six categories of
locations, such as home, on the way, workplace, school, supermarket,
and public area. The location “ home ” , “ workplace ” and “ school ”
represent the locations where the agent lives, works or studies. Location
“ on the way ” indicates that the agent is moving to another location.
Location “ Supermarket ” represents the supermarkets and other smaller
retailing stores inside the community. Location “ public area ” represents
the public area inside the community, such as gyms, playground,
swimming pool and garden etc. With UE, we construct the virtual
community containing all the apartments for agents, all the retailing
stores in interest, all the other public area inside the community and a
Fig. 9. Examples of prompts sent to LLM for the grades of behaving normal. The first one is graded 0 because the agent got up and down repeatedly during the night.
The second one is graded 50 because even though the agent got up earlier than normal, they still follow their daily routine. The last one is graded 100 because the
agent follows the routine and behave as normal as a real person.

road system to connect them together. Then, we generate 3000 virtual
agents according to Section 4.2 . We build the reward system based on
the real phone usage data and the fine-tuned LLM. Once the environ -
ment and agents are reset or initialized, the time for the environment is
set to be 0:00 on Monday and all the agents are set to be sleeping at
home.
4.6. Observations of agents and actions
There are 10 kinds of observations in total. We divide them into 2
major groups: environment based, as well as agent based.
• Environment Based Observations:
1. Day of the Week: This observation provides information about the
day of the week.
2. Holiday: This observation indicates whether it is a holiday.
3. Hours: This observation indicates which hour the current simulation
is at.
4. Minutes: This observation indicates which minute the current
simulation is at.
• Agent Based Observations:
1. Action: This observation indicates the action the agent is taking at
current timestep.
2. Last Action: This observation indicates the action the agent was
taking at the last timestep.
3. Location: This observation indicates where the agent is located at
current timestep.
4. Last Location: This observation indicates where the agent was
located at the last timestep.
5. Phone Usage: This observation indicates whether the agent is using
their phone at current timestep.
6. Age: This observation indicates the age of the agent.
In total, there are 13 actions available in the action space. We can
categorize them into 2 groups: movement and non-movement . Group of
movement contains the actions of moving to other places. Group of non-
movement contains actions not involving movement to another place.
• Movement actions:
1. Go Home: Each agent has been assigned to their own apartment once
the experiment begins. This action will instruct the agent to go to
their own apartment.
2. Go to Workplace: This action will instruct the agent to go to work.
Since we have only constructed the environment for the community
by now, once the agent takes this action, we would set the agent's
destination as the gate of the community, let them wait for their
corresponding commuting time and then mark them as working. This
action is restricted to the employed adults. Agents in other life stages
cannot take this action.
3. Go to School: This action will instruct the agent to go to school. For
the same reason as the action to go to work, we apply the same
approach to simulate the commuting process. This action is exclusive
to students.
4. Go to Public Area: The agent taking this action will go to a random
public area inside the community. There are several places available
such as gym, park, swimming pool etc. as described in Section 4.1 .
5. Go to Stores: The agent taking this action will go to a random store
inside the community.
• Non-movement actions listed by the restrictions from locations:
1. Home: There are 4 actions available at home: sleep, relax, eat, and
read.
2. Public Area: At the public area inside the community, agents can take
the actions of exercise.
3. Stores: Agents can only take the action of shopping at the stores in -
side the community.
4. Workplace: Agent can only take the action of working at their
workplace.
5. School: Agent can only take the action of studying at their school

4.7. Comprehensive design of rewards
The environment generates reward for each agent based on their
action and current state. In our framework, we construct rewards in
combined layers of micro-level and macro-level. Micro-level LLM
reward is gained from the gradings by LLM, and the macro-level sta -
tistical reward is computed from the difference between Simulated and
Real Phone Usage. Then, we take the average value of these two layers of
rewards and use this value for model training.
In each timestep, a prompt containing the agent's information, cur -
rent time and agent's action histories is sent to the LLM engine and wait
for the model to grade it. If the agent is a student or employed adult, the
content would also contain the features of Routine Action and Go Home
Time. These pieces of information would help the LLM grade the agent's
behavior more precisely. Fig. 9 shows a few prompts and their corre -
sponding grade given by the LLM.
For each timestep, all the agents' histories of actions by this step
would be rated by the LLM. Once the grades of all agents are collected,
they would be normalized to fall in the interval of   1 and 1 as the final
reward from LLM in this timestep, for which they are referred as “ LLM
Rewards ” .
Another reward is computed based on the difference between Real
and Simulated Phone Usage. This reward reflects how the AI agents
behave in the group (macro) level, for which it is called macro-level
statistical reward.
In each timestep, if the AI agent is taking the action of read, relax,
shop, and exercise, we mark this agent using phone at this time (t). We
compute the proportion of phone users among the AI agents and denote
it as P
Sim , t
. We denote the proportion of phone users derived from the
Real Phone Usage as P
Real , t
. We take the difference between them as
D
t
= P
Sim , t
  P
Stat , t
. We use the variable U
i , t
to denote whether the agent
i is using their smartphone at timestep t . U
i , t
= 1 if the agent is using the
phone and U
i , t
= 0 if the agent is not. Then, we assign the macro-level
statistical reward for agent i at timestep t as Eq. (4) .
r

⎧

(4)
Equation 4: If the difference between the Simulated and Real Phone
Usage is less than 0.1, we consider it trivial and don't assign reward to
any agents. If the Simulated Phone Usage is significantly larger than Real
Phone Usage ( D
t
> 0 . 1 ), we assign positive reward for the AI agents not
using phones and negative to those using. Similarly, when the Real
Phone Usage is significantly higher, we assign positive reward to AI
agents using phones and negative to AI agents not using.
In the current context where AI ethics and moral issues have sparked
widespread attention and concerns, any responsible algorithm model
must ensure that its algorithms are free from gender discrimination and
bias. The reward system is the only part of the whole framework where
the gender discrimination and bias may be produced and we have
eliminated this potentiality. The macro-level statistical reward is
computed purely based on the phone usage, the feature of gender is
entirely excluded from this type of reward. As for the micro-level reward
generated from the grades generated by LLMs, the way we fine-tuned the
LLM is a process of the LLM learning from human feedback. The training
data for fine tuning is generated by volunteers containing half males and
half females. In this way, we have eliminated the potential gender
discrimination or bias of LLM.
4.8. Computing resource used for training and simulation
Through the process of training, we use two computer machines and
an additional “ A30 ” GPU chip in total. Both computer machines are
installed with “ AMD Ryzen 9 7950X ” CPU and “ NVIDIA GeForce RTX
4080 ” GPU. We start the UE environment in one machine and run the
training process for 3000 AI agents in the other one. The large language
model used for grading is deployed in the “ A30 ” chip. It takes 20 h to
train each epoch.
For the simulation process of 3000 AI agents, only one computer
machine with the same computing power mentioned above is required.
It takes less than 1 min to simulate one step (10 min) through the
simulation process.
4.9. Training and validating procedure
In each episode, we simulate for a whole week, which is 10,080 min
in total. We collect data from the environment every 10 min, so there are
T = 1008 timesteps in total for a complete episode. Each of N = 512
agent collects q = 4 timesteps of data and then we construct the loss L on
these Nq pieces of data with clipping factor ϵ and entropy factor β . Then,
we update the parameter θ for policy network at the learning rate α with
the loss constructed. We provide the procedure of one complete episode
code as the following.
Algorithm . Virtual community and resident.
After 4 iterations of training, we deploy the policy model and
generate the simulation of one week as presented in Section 2 . Unlike
the evaluation of testing sets in supervised training, comparison with
human experts is commonly used to evaluate RL. Since we constructed
our own virtual environment and action space, there is no previous
