Figure 1: OASIS can simulate different social media platforms, such as X and Reddit, and supports
simulations of up to millions of LLM-based agents.
ABSTRACT
There has been a growing interest in enhancing rule-based agent-based models
(ABMs) for social media platforms (i.e., X, Reddit) with more realistic large lan-
guage model (LLM) agents, thereby allowing for a more nuanced study of com-
plex systems. As a result, several LLM-based ABMs have been proposed in the
past year. While they hold promise, each simulator is specifically designed to
study a particular scenario, making it time-consuming and resource-intensive to
explore other phenomena using the same ABM. Additionally, these models sim-
ulate only a limited number of agents, whereas real-world social media platforms
involve millions of users. To this end, we propose OASIS, a generalizable and
scalable social media simulator. OASIS is designed based on real-world social
media platforms, incorporating dynamically updated environments (i.e., dynamic
social networks and post information), diverse action spaces (i.e., following, com-
menting), and recommendation systems (i.e., interest-based and hot-score-based).
Additionally, OASIS supports large-scale user simulations, capable of modeling
up to one million users. With these features, OASIS can be easily extended to
different social media platforms to study large-scale group phenomena and be-
haviors. We replicate various social phenomena, including information spreading,
group polarization, and herd effects across X and Reddit platforms. Moreover, we
provide observations of social phenomena at different agent group scales. We ob-
serve that the larger agent group scale leads to more enhanced group dynamics and
more diverse and helpful agents’ opinions. These findings demonstrate OASIS’s
potential as a powerful tool for studying complex systems in digital environments.

1 I NTRODUCTION
Complex societal systems ( e.g., social media, cities, ecosystems, and financial markets) are char-
acterized by many interconnected and interdependent components or agents. These interactions
give rise to emergent behaviors that cannot be predicted by analyzing the actions of individual
alone (Ladyman et al., 2013). These systems are important in the increasingly digital world we
live in, but conducting experiments with complex systems can be very costly in terms of time and
resources. Therefore, scientists have often relied on mathematical or agent-based models (ABMs) to
understand, analyze, or predict phenomena and outcomes that are difficult or impossible to conduct
real-world experiments (e.g., misinformation propagation (Gausen et al., 2022), online polarization
(Song & Boomgaarden, 2017), and herd effect (Lee & Lee, 2015)).
As the name suggests, ABMs consist of computationalagents programmed to interact among them-
selves or with the environment in a realistic manner that is relevant to the complex system under
study (Gilbert, 2019). Simulating agent behaviors is the key to designing ABMs. Traditionally,
agent behaviors are programmed along measurable value ( i.e., thresholds), which overlooks more
complex aspects such as context-dependent behavioral changes. Recently, large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability to mimic human behaviors (Park et al., 2022;
2023; 2024; Zhou et al., 2023b). LLM agents can engage in role-playing, i.e., impersonating human
characters and taking part in a human-like interaction with other agents (Park et al., 2023; Zhou
et al., 2023b), as well as taking a wide variety of actions ranging from simple decisions to more
complex ones involving the tool use (Qin et al., 2023). To develop and evaluate these LLM agents,
researchers will need to move beyond standard benchmarks by defining social situations and distinct
personas, as well as integrating these agents into simulated platforms or sandbox environments for
more comprehensive testing and analysis (Park et al., 2023).
In the context of social media studies, popular social media platforms ( i.e., X, Reddit) have dras-
tically changed how people interact, exchange information, and form communities, making them
crucial environments for studying modern social dynamics V osoughi et al. (2018). They vary in
how they design user interactions, henceforth termed action space, how they interact with users
through algorithms(Info Filter), as well as how they connect with each other ( Dynamic Network)
For example, X facilitates a rapid exchange of views in real-time, and Reddit supports topic-based
communities and emphasizes comment interaction. Consequently, users behave very differently
across platforms, and as a result, several LLM-based ABM studies (see Table 1) have been proposed
recently to study some aspects of social interactions on one of these platforms. Given the specific
scenarios studied under these ABMs, pivoting them to study another domain remains tedious, which
limits their usability to a larger social sciences community. Furthermore, these real-world social
media contain millions of users. Simulating a large-scale ABM would allow for studies across mul-
tiple platforms, either individually or collectively, but it also introduces a wide range of engineering
challenges. To this end, we propose OASIS, a collection of generalizable and scalable ABMs to
simulate a wide variety of phenomena in various social media platforms.
How OASIS works and why OASIS is generalizable? OASIS is built upon five foundational com-
ponents, as shown in Figure 2, including the Environment Server, Info Filter, Agent Module, Time
Engine, and Scalable Inferencer. The Environment Server is initialized using generated or real-world
data. It sends agents’ information, such as user descriptions and their relationships, along with posts,
to the Info Filter. The Info filter selects and pushes posts to agents through filtering algorithms, de-
termining the visibility of content for each agent. The Time Engine activates agents based on their
temporal characteristics, enabling them to perform various actions such as commenting, posting,
and interacting with other agents and the environment. These actions then update the environment’s
state in real-time. All these components can be adapted easily to experiment with different social
media platforms. For instance, by adjusting specific modules, switching from one platform, such as
X, to another like Reddit is possible.
Why scalability matters and how OASIS support scalable design? The scale has been proven es-
sential in domains like vision and language modeling, as certain model behaviors only emerge with
sufficient scale (Kaplan et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 2022). Recent works Chopra et al. (2024); Gao
et al. (2024) also explore simulations that scale up the number of agents to the million level. Still,
the importance of the scale of LLM-based ABMs remains largely under-explored in existing liter-
ature. OASIS supports large-scale user simulations, ranging from hundreds to millions of agents.

the number of agents in the simulation. Environment (Env.) refers to the environment in which the
agents operate, with a ’-’ indicating that no specific environment has been defined. Action Space

Our findings demonstrate that increasing the number of agents is crucial for accurately simulating
group behavior and making user perspectives more valuable and diverse. To facilitate these large-
scale simulations, we develop a comprehensive user generation method that enables extensive agent
experiments, along with an advanced multi-processing technique to efficiently handle high-demand
inference requests. Additionally, the RecSys allows agents to access information of personal in-
terest from a large volume of data, thereby facilitating more structured and organized large-scale
interactions.
To validate the effectiveness ofOASIS, we replicate various social phenomena (such as information
spreading, group polarization, and the herd effect) across different platforms (X and Reddit). The
experimental results indicate that OASIS can closely replicate phenomena and outcomes observed
in human society, including trends in information spreading, the increasing polarization of agent
opinions within the interaction, and the herd effect among agents. Additionally, we also observe
unique phenomena within agent societies, such as more severe group polarization in uncensored
LLMs and agents being more susceptible to the herd effect compared to humans. Furthermore, we
find that the number of agents plays a significant role in simulating group behavior as well as in
the diversity and helpfulness of agents’ opinions. We hope that OASIS will support research across
various disciplines and contribute to the future study of agent-based societies.
2 M ETHODOLOGY
OASIS is developed to create a highly generalizable LLM-based simulator for various social media.
In this section, we describe the workflow and critical internal mechanisms of OASIS, which enable
it to be easily generalized and scaled to support the simulation of millions of LLM-based agents.
2.1 W ORKFLOW OF OASIS
OASIS is built upon the structure of traditional social media platforms and consists of five key com-
ponents: Environment Server, RecSys, Agent Module, Time Engine, and Scalable Inferencer.
Registration Phase. During the registration phase, OASIS requires users’ information, including
name, self-description, and historical posts. After registration, each user (or agent) receives a char-
acter description and an action description, guiding them to better align with their characteristics
and to perform specific actions on various social media platforms.
Simulation Phase. In the simulation phase, the environment sends user-related information—such
as the user’s past behavior and self-description to the RecSys. The RecSys filters posts from the
environment and suggests posts that are likely to be of interest to the agent. Based on these posts,
the agent’s self-description, and other contextual factors, the agent selects actions to take, such as
liking or reposting a post. Chain-of-Thought (CoT, Wei et al. (2022)) reasoning is incorporated,

Update
Figure 2: The workflow of OASIS. During the registration phase, real-world or generated user in-
formation will be registered on the Environment Server. In the simulation phase, the Environment
Server sends agent information, posts, and users’ relations to the RecSys, which then suggests posts
to agents based on their social connections, interests, or hot score of posts. LLM agents receive
the recommended posts and generate actions and rationales based on the contents. These actions
ultimately update the state of the environment in real-time. The Time Engine manages the agents’
temporal behaviors, while the Scalable Inference handles large-scale inference requests from users.
enabling the agent to generate reasoning alongside its actions. The agent’s activation is governed
by the time engine, which stores the user’s hourly activity probability in a 24-dimension list. Based
on these usage patterns, the time engine probabilistically activates the agent at specific times. After
the agent performs actions, the results are updated in the environment server. For example, newly
created posts are added to the post table in the database, or the user’s relations network is updated
when they follow a new user.
2.2 E NVIRONMENT SERVER
The role of the environment server is to maintain the status and data of social media platforms, such
as users’ information, posts, and user relationships. We implement the environment server using a
relational database to manage and store this information efficiently. The detailed database structure
is provided in the appendix D.2. The environment server is primarily composed of six components:
users, posts, comments, relations, traces, and recommendations. The user table stores basic infor-
mation about each user, such as their name and biography. The post table and the comment table
each contain all the posts and comments made on the platform, including detailed information like
the number of likes and the creation time. The relations component comprises multiple tables that
store various types of relationships, such as follow and mutual relationships between users, likes
between users and posts, among others. Each user’s entire action history is recorded in thetrace ta-
ble. The recommendation table is populated by the output of the RecSys after analyzing the user’s
trace table. The database can be dynamically updated. For example, new users, posts, comments,
and follow relationships can be added over time.
2.3 R ECSYS
The role of the RecSys is to control the information seen by agents, playing a crucial part in shaping
the information flow. We develop RecSys for two popular social media platforms: X and Reddit.
For X, following X official report (Twitter, 2023), the recommended posts come from two sources:
in-network (users followed by the agent) and out-of-network (posts from the broader simulation
world). In-network content is ranked by popularity (likes) before recommendation. Out-of-network
posts, as shown in Figure 3, are recommended based on interest matching using TwHIN-BERT
(Zhang et al., 2023), which models user interests based on profiles and recent activities by vectors’
similarity. Factors like recency (prioritizing newer posts) and the number of followers of the post’s

creator (simulating superuser broadcasting) are also taken into account to recommend relevant out-
of-network posts, details are presented in Appendix D.3. Additionally, the post count from in-
network and out-of-network sources can be adjusted to suit different scenarios.

Figure 3: The pipeline of the out-of-network post recsys.
For Reddit, the RecSys is modeled based on Reddit’s disclosed post ranking algorithm (Salihefendic,
2015), which calculates a hot score to prioritize posts. This score integrates likes, dislikes, and
created time, ensuring that the most recent and popular posts are ranked at the top, while those less
popular or controversial rank lower. Specifically, the calculation formula is:
h = log 10 (max (|u − d| , 1)) + sign(u − d) · t − t0
45000 (1)
where h indicates the hot score, u represents the number of upvotes, d represents the number of
downvotes, and t is the submission time in seconds since the Unix epoch, t0 = 1134028003 . We
rank the posts based on hot scores to identify the top k posts for recommendation, with the number
of recommended posts ( i.e., k) varying depending on the experiment; further details are presented
in Appendix F.4.2.
2.4 A GENT MODULE
Our agent module is based on large language models, and the core features of the agent module are
inherited from CAMEL (Li et al., 2023). The agent module consists primarily of amemory module
and an action module. The memory module stores information the agent has encountered. To help
the agent better understand its role when performing actions, the memory includes sufficient infor-
mation about posts, e.g. the number of likes, comments, and the likes on comments. Additionally,
it stores the user’s previous actions and the reasoning behind them. The action module enables 21
different types of interactions with the environment, including sign up, refresh, trend, search posts,
search users, create post, repost, follow, unfollow, mute, like, unlike, dislike, undo dislike, unmute,
create comment, like comment, unlike comment, dislike comment, undo dislike comment, and do
nothing. The details of these actions are available in the Appendix D.1. We also utilize CoT reason-
ing to enhance the interpretability of the agent behaviors. By incorporating a larger action space, we
increase user interaction diversity, making them closer to real-world social media platforms.
2.5 T IME ENGINE
It is crucial to incorporate temporal features into the agent’s simulation to accurately reflect how
their real-world identities influence online behavior patterns. To address this, we define each agent’s
hourly activity level based on historical interaction frequency or customized settings. Each agent is
initialized with a 24-dimensional vector representing the probability of activity in each hour. The
simulation environment activates agents based on these probabilities, rather than activating all agents
5

Preprint
simultaneously. Moreover, we manage time progression within the simulation environment using a
time step approach (i.e., one time step is equal to 3 minutes in OASIS), similar to the approach used
in Park et al. (2023), which accommodates varying LLM inference speeds across different setups.
Additionally, since the creation time of a post within a single time step is crucial for the Reddit
recommendation system, we propose an alternative time-flow setting. This setting linearly maps
real-world time using a scale factor to adjust the simulation time, ensuring that actions executed
earlier within the same time step are recorded with earlier timestamps in the database.
2.6 S CALABLE DESIGN
Scalable Inference We design a highly concurrent distributed system where agents, the environ-
ment server, and inference services operate as independent modules, exchanging data through infor-
mation communication channels. The system leverages asynchronous mechanisms to allow agents
to send multiple requests concurrently, even while waiting for responses from previous interactions,
and the environment module processes incoming messages in parallel. Inference services manage
GPU resources through a dedicated manager, which balances agent requests across available GPUs
to ensure efficient resource utilization. For more details, see Appendix D.4.
Large-scale User Generation The user generation algorithm addresses platform constraints and
privacy concerns by combining real user data with a relationship network model, simulating up to
one million users while preserving the scale-free nature of social networks. It generates diverse
user profiles based on population distributions, simplifying dimensions like age, personality, and
profession as independent variables. Core and ordinary users are linked into a network using interest-
based sampling, with a 0.2 probability of following core users, ensuring diversity and preventing
network density. Details are presented in Appendix E.1, E.2 and E.3.
3 E XPERIMENT
Although OASIS has the potential to be applied for various computational inquiries, we primarily
focus on two research questions below:
1. Can OASIS be adapted to various platforms and scenarios to replicate real-world phenom-
ena? We demonstrate the generalizability ofOASIS by replicating three influential computational
social science studies. Specifically, we simulate information propagation (V osoughi et al., 2018)
and the resulting group polarization (Lindesmith et al., 1999) on rapid information exchange
platforms like X and the herd effect (Muchnik et al., 2013) on topic-based community-oriented
platforms like Reddit.
2. Does the agent population affect the accuracy of simulating group behavior?We conduct so-
ciological experiments at various scales of agents, ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of
agents, and identify (if any) emergent sociological phenomena as the number of agents increases.
3.1 E XPERIMENTAL SCENARIOS
Information propagation on X. Information propagation refers to the propagation of messages
through a network, influenced by varied factors (e.g., network structure, message content, and indi-
vidual interactions). It is crucial for understanding phenomena like information spreading and group
polarization. In this section, we explore two key aspects: information spreading, the transmission
of messages across a network; and group polarization, where social interactions foster increasingly
extreme opinions. Our analysis focuses on these dynamics within the X platform.
Herd effect in Reddit. Herd effect refers to individuals’ tendency to follow the actions or opinions
of a larger group without independent thought or analysis. For example, users tend to like a post
that has already received likes or reflect a general inclination to conform to majority opinions. Our
analysis focuses on these dynamics within the Reddit platform.

Preprint
3.2 E XPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
For information spreading, we collect 198 real-world instances from two rumor detection datasets,
Twitter15 (Liu et al., 2015) and Twitter16 (Ma et al., 2016), covering 9 categories ( e.g., business,
education, and politics). Each instance includes 100 to 700 users and the information propagation
path of the source post. Using the X API, we retrieve user profiles, follow relationships, and previ-
ous posts, computing users’ hourly activity levels (See Appendix E.1 for details). Agents in OASIS
are initialized with this data, and their most recent posts will also be included in the simulator to be
propagated along with the source post for better alignment with real-world scenario (Section 2.1).
For group polarization, we select 196 real users’ information from the information-spreading ex-
periment (these real users have a large following on X and they are from different areas.) and using
LLMs to generate synthetic users with up to 1 million scale (Prompts and details are presented in
Appendix E.2). Real users are set as core users, with generated users forming follow-up relation-
ships based on topics like sports and entertainment. Forherd effect, we first closely follow Muchnik
et al. (2013) and collect 116,932 real comments from Reddit across seven topics and use LLMs to
generate profiles for 3,600 users. Second, we collect 21,919 counterfactual content posts (Meng
et al., 2022) and generate 10,000 users. Comments or posts are divided into three groups: the down-
treated group (one initial dislike), the control group (no initial likes or dislikes), and the up-treated
group (one initial like). We simulate 40 or 30 time steps of interactions for each experiment on
Reddit, introducing initially-rated comments or posts at the beginning of each time step (Details
are presented in Appendix E.3 and F.4.2). Llama3-8b-instruct is used as the base LLM. We adjust
agent actions to accommodate different scenarios, with specific actions for each scenario detailed in
Appendix F.1.
Evaluation Metrics For information spreading in X, following V osoughi et al. (2018), we mea-
sure the information spreading paths using three key metrics: scale (the number of users participat-
ing in the propagation over time), depth (the maximum depth of the propagation graph of the source
post), and max breadth (the largest number of users participating in the propagation at any depth).
We then compute the Normalized RMSE between each simulation and real-world metric curves,
averaging these values to represent OASIS’s overall error. Additionally, We calculate the Normal-
ized RMSE at each minute to evaluate precise alignment and use mean and confidence intervals to
understand relative magnitudes under different settings. While averaging curves makes this metric
unsuitable for precise alignment with real data (For example, the error caused by a higher metric
value in the simulation of source post A compared to the real data could be balanced out by a lower
value in a simulation of the source post B), confidence intervals provide some level of analysis for
alignment, and it helps observe relative size differences, which RMSE cannot. (For more details of
these metrics please see Appendix F.2). Forgroup polarization, we follow the alignment evaluation
metric and the Safe RLHF Benchmark (Dai et al., 2023), using GPT-4o-mini to assess which opin-
ions are more extreme or helpful (prompts and details are presented in Appenix F.3). This approach
allows for a more precise analysis of the evolution of users’ opinions. Forherd effect, we utilize two
evaluation metrics. The first is thepost score, which is calculated as the difference between the num-
ber of upvotes and downvotes a post receives after user interaction. The second metric, thedisagree
score, is applied to counterfactual posts, where we evaluate the degree of disagreement expressed in
comments responding to the counterfactual content. Further details regarding the evaluation metrics
can be found in Appendix F.4.1).
3.3 C AN OASIS BE ADAPTED TO VARIOUS PLATFORMS AND SCENARIOS TO REPLICATE
REAL -WORLD PHENOMENA ?
3.3.1 I NFORMATION PROPAGATION IN X
Finding 1: OASIS can replicate the information spreading process in the real world in terms
of scale and maximum breadth without evident offset; however, the depth trend is smaller
compared to real-world trends. We compare the simulation information propagation process with
the real-world ground truth in Figure 4. Overall, the OASIS simulation results align with real-world
information dissemination trends well, with an error margin of normalized RMSE around 30%.
This validates OASIS’s effectiveness in modeling these dynamics. However, we observe that the
depth of OASIS simulation propagation is smaller than the real-world propagation in Figure 4. This
discrepancy likely arises from the complexity and precision of real-world RecSys and user profiles.

Figure 5: Evaluation results of group polarization for uncensored and aligned Llama-3-8B. The red
bar indicates the opinion is more extreme compared with the round 0. The blue bar indicated more
progressive and the green bar indicated draw. We also demonstrate the examples of different rounds
on the right side of each figure.
While our RecSys effectively captures the broadcasting effect of super users, data limitations hinder
its ability to accurately represent nuanced user profiles. As a result, the simplified design of our
RecSys struggles to model intermediary users with the same level of precision.
Finding 2: OASIS can replicate the phenomenon of group polarization, where opinions become
increasingly extreme during information propagation. This effect is even more pronounced in
uncensored models. Studying how users’ opinions evolve during information propagation is cru-
cial. Here, we examine group polarization during information propagation. Group Polarization oc-
curs when individuals with similar views adopt more extreme positions after exchanging opinions.
For example, a group with moderately conservative views may become more conservative through
interaction. Here, we set a hypothetical scenario where users on X discuss a classic dilemma (Linde-
smith et al., 1999): Should Halen take the risk to write a great novel, or should he continue writing
ordinary novels without taking any risks? We let one user post a discussion (see Appendix F.3.1)
about the dilemma, and then the discussion was held among 196 core users. After extensive infor-
mation propagation, we collect every agent’s advice aboutwhat should Halen do? at every 10 time
steps in the form of a questionnaire (see Appendix F.3.2) and analyze the changes in their views
over different periods of interaction. Initially, agents are assigned conservative views with prompts.
The entire simulation will last for 80 time steps, every 10 time steps we would use GPT-4o-mini to
compare the opinions gathered with the initial opinions and judge which is more conservative. The
results are as follows:
We discover that as the interaction progresses, agents’ responses to Halen’s suggestions become
increasingly conservative, especially in interactions with uncensored models (The uncensored model
has been stripped of its safety guardrails). The uncensored model tends to use more extreme phrases,
such as ’always better’ and similar expressions. These findings suggest that LLM-based agents
exhibit a tendency toward extremism during social interactions, as their attitudes shift from moderate
to extreme over time.

Figure 6: The figure displays the mean comment scores for up-treated comments (initially liked),
down-treated comments (initially disliked), and control group comments (with no likes or dislikes),
along with 95% confidence intervals for both humans and LLM agents across the seven topic cate-
gories. Red indicates the results for humans, while blue represents the results for LLM agents. The
red box shows that for the down-treated comments group the agents are more likely to exhibit herd
effect, which differs significantly from humans.
3.3.2 H ERD EFFECT IN REDDIT
We simulate agents’ interactions on comments of different topics using OASIS for 40 time steps.
The average scores of all comments after all time steps in the experiment are shown in the figure 6.
Finding 3: Agents are more inclined to herd effect, while humans possess a stronger critical
mind. As shown in Figure 6, for the up-treated group, the simulation results of the agent and humans
are relatively close, showing a high level of consistency. However, for the down-treated group, the
human group’s scores are significantly higher than the results observed from agent group. This
suggests that when an initial comment receives a dislike, agents tend to follow others’ behavior by
further disliking the post or giving fewer likes, whereas humans, on the other hand, tend to deliberate
more carefully and are more likely to increase the like score.
3.4 D OES THE NUMBER OF AGENTS AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF SIMULATING GROUP
BEHAVIOR ?
3.4.1 I NFORMATION PROPAGATION IN X
A natural question to ask is how an increasing number of agents might influence group polarization
and individual user opinions. Therefore, we conduct experiments on group polarization at different
agent scales i.e., from 196 to 100K. To investigate how the same agents’ opinions change across
different scales, we collect suggestions from the same 196 users in all experiments. The other
experimental settings are kept consistent with those described in group polarization. We run the
simulation for 30 time steps. We visualize the distribution of agents’ opinions at different scales
using Nomic Atlas (Nomic, 2024), as shown in Figure 7.
Finding 4: Larger group leads to more helpful and diverse responses.As shown in Figure 7, we
find that when the number of agents increases from 196 to 10,196, there is a significant enhancement
in the diversity of user opinions. Additionally, following the evaluation criteria from Safe-RLHF
(Dai et al., 2023), we assess which set of user opinions—those from 196 or 10,196 agents—is more
helpful. The results indicate that the helpfulness of the 10,196 agents is significantly better than that
of the 196 agents. When the number of agents is further expanded to 100,196, the helpfulness of
user opinions improves even more. This suggests that as the user base grows, core users are exposed
to a more diverse and enriching set of responses, leading to more varied and helpful interactions.
3.4.2 H ERD EFFECT IN REDDIT
Finding 5: When faced with counterfactual posts, the agent exhibits herd effect only in re-
sponse to dislikes, and this effect becomes more pronounced as the number of agents increases.
In this section, we conduct an experiment to investigate whether agents would exhibit herd effect

when exposed to counterfactual posts ( i.e., misinformation). Interestingly, we observed that when
the number of agents was small, there appeared to be no herd effect, as there was no difference in
scores between the up-treated, control, and down-treated groups. This raised the question of whether
herd effect was truly absent. We then increased the number of agents from 100 to 10,000, and found
that the agents began to exhibit explicit herd effect. The disagree scores in the down-treated group
were significantly higher than those in the control and up-treated groups. Additionally, there was
a noticeable increase in the scores, suggesting that large-scale groups tend to guide agents toward
self-correction. For specific examples of this phenomenon, illustrated through posts and comments,
see Appendix F.4.3.

3.5 S IMULATING LARGE -SCALE MISINFORMATION SPREADING ON PLATFORM X USING
OASIS
In the following subsection, we focus on Platform X (formerly Twitter), analyzing how both true
and false information spread among millions of agents. Unlike Reddit, the action space on Twitter
includes creating posts, repost, like post, dislike post, follow, create comment, like comment, and
dislike comment. Additionally, we shift from the hot-score based recommendation system to an
interest-based one.
Experiment Setting We select four news stories from official sources, covering health, technol-
ogy, entertainment, and education. We then fabricate four pieces of misinformation that closely
resemble the official news. Details are provided in Appendix G.0.1. The experiment includes 196
core agents (with a large number of followers) and 1 million regular agents, as described in Sec-
tion ??. e ask the same core user to post both the true and fake versions of each of the four pieces of
news. The simulation runs for 60 time steps, with an activation probability of 0.1 for core users and
0.01 for regular users. The experiment is conducted on 24 A100 GPUs within a week.
10

Preprint
Misinformation is more influential than the official news. To investigate the impact of official
news and misinformation on the new posts generated by agents, we employ the TF-IDF-based ap-
proach (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency Christian et al. (2016)). Specifically, we
calculate the cosine similarity between 8 news (including 4 pairs of official and misinformation
news) and a simulated set of 733824 posts generated by agents. A similarity threshold of 0.2 was
set, with posts exceeding this threshold considered relevant to the target news. We then track the
number of posts related to official news and misinformation at each time step, and the results are
shown in the Figure 9. As illustrated in the figure, for each topic, the number of posts related to
misinformation consistently exceeds those related to official news. In the early stages, the number
of posts related to both official news and misinformation increases rapidly due to the smaller number
of relevant posts. However, over time, the number of posts declines quickly as posts on other topics
gain more traction. Even in the later stages, posts related to misinformation maintain a higher level
of activity, suggesting that misinformation has a more sustained influence.
Furthermore, We visualize the new attention relationships formed during the simulation process. We
find that these new connections exhibit a certain clustering phenomenon, where users tend to form
concentrated clusters, with some forming densely connected central areas and others being more
isolated. These subgraphs indicate the existence of complex relational networks, suggesting distinct
communities within the overall structure.
Figure 9: TThe figure shows the number of posts related to official news and misinformation at
various time steps across different topics. For each topic, posts related to misinformation are more
numerous than those related to official news.

represents a new follow relationship, and each node represents an agent. Clustering is observable

4 A BLATION STUDY
4.1 A BLATION OF COMPONENTS IN OASIS
We conduct ablation experiments on various modules ofOASIS, including the RecSys, and the tem-
poral feature used in Time Engine. For the RecSys, we find that its absence significantly hampers the
spread of information, limiting the potential for wide dissemination. Testing different models such
as MiniLM v6 (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), BERT (Devlin, 2018), and TwHIN-BERT. We observe
that TwHIN-BERT, which pre-trained on over 7 billion tweets in100+ languages, performs particu-
larly well in capturing similarities between different posts. For the temporal feature, we replace the
24-dimensional activity probability list, extracted from the crawled user’s previous post frequency,
with a list where each dimension is set to 1. The results demonstrate that the activity probability
from real-world data is essential for accurately reproducing real-world data dissemination patterns.
Further visualization and experiment results can be found in Appendix C, The primary metric we
use here is the Normalized RMSE at every minute for a more detailed analysis.
5 C ONCLUSION
We present OASIS, a generalizable and scalable social media simulator designed to replicate real-
world social media dynamics. OASIS incorporates modular components that capture the core func-
tionalities of social media platforms, enabling it to be easily adapted across different platforms.
Moreover, OASIS supports large-scale user interactions, accommodating up to 1 million users. Us-
ing OASIS, we have reproduced several well-known social phenomena and uncovered unique be-
haviors emerging from LLM-driven simulations. We also identified distinctive patterns in group
behavior that vary with different group sizes. We hope OASIS can provide valuable insights for
future research on social group dynamics and general multi-agent interactions.

B R ELATED WORK
B.1 S OCIAL MEDIA
Social media encompasses websites and applications focused on communication, interaction, and
content-sharing (Kapoor et al., 2018). While it offers benefits like allowing individuals to explore
their identities without real-world consequences (Nature Reviews Psychology, 2024), the risk of
hazardous social media phenomena gradually becomes a global threat with significant economic,
political, and social consequences. Traditional threats includes promoting risky behaviors (Nature
Reviews Psychology, 2024), contributing to mental health issues among teenagers (Odgers, 2024),
social influence (Muchnik et al., 2013), group Polarization (Iandoli et al., 2021; Isenberg, 1986),
and spreading misinformation (V osoughi et al., 2018; Waldrop, 2023). Despite numerous studies on
social media phenomena, the complex network structures, vast data, and diverse behaviors present
challenges for researchers. Additionally, ethical concerns (Moreno et al., 2013) arise in some of
these studies. To address these issues, a controllable virtual environment (e.g., a multi-agent system)
for social simulation is needed, allowing researchers to test hypotheses on a virtual platform.

B.2 M ULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS
Multi-agent systems are composed of multiple autonomous entities, each possessing different in-
formation and diverging interests. Compared to single-agent platforms, multi-agent platforms of-
fer several advantages, including (1) the ability to assume different roles in group activities, and
(2) richer and more complex interaction behaviors, such as collaboration, discussion, and strategic
competition. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of multi-agent systems across various
domains.
Divided by various functionality, recent multi-agent systems can be roughly divided to tool-based
agent assistants (Qian et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024; Mosquera et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024), as
well as society or game simulation environments (Li et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a; Huang et al.,
2024; Yu et al., 2024). The former part focus on collaborating a small group of LLM-based agents
to automatically conduct predefined or open-ended tasks. And the latter part focus on involving a
large-scale agent groups to automatically run a simulator in a specific environment. Since the action
and relationship in a large society is extremely complicated, capability scalability has become the
fundamental issue of this work. In this work, we highly focus on leveraging multi-agent systems to
explore corresponding characteristics in social simulation research.
B.3 M ULTI-AGENT SYSTEM SOCIAL SIMULATION
Social simulation plays a crucial role in social science research, with many classic agent-based mod-
eling (ABM) studies, such as Schelling’s model of segregation (Schelling, 1969), the Chicago sim-
ulation (Macal et al., 2018), and the pandemic (Gupta et al., 2024; Chopra et al., 2023). Traditional
ABM has limitations such as subjective rule design and scalability issues. With the development
of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have demonstrated significant advantages in
social simulation: (1) The ability to interact using natural language. (2) A more accurate simulation
of human behavior. (3) The capability to utilize more complex tools. There have been numerous
related studies, such as the exploration of multi-agent behavior patterns (Park et al., 2023), simula-
tions of social networks (Gao et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023b), and the study of society’s response to
misinformation (Chen & Shu, 2023). Social simulation not only serves as a tool for social science
research but also aids in exploring the boundaries of LLMs’ capabilities. For example, studies on
social alignment (Liu et al., 2023), emergence of social norms (Ren et al., 2024). However, cur-
rent LLM-related social simulations mainly focus on interactions among a small number of agents.
Yet, research on collective behavior often requires a critical mass to observe emergent phenom-
ena. Therefore, our work emphasizes the interaction of large-scale agents to study the emergence of
collective behaviors.

C.2 R ECOMMEND SYSTEM ABLATION
To verify the impact of RecSys on message dissemination, we conduct ablation studies on the exis-
tence of the RecSys itself and the RecSys model (different models to embed posts and profiles). For
these experiments, we randomly select 28 topics (Here, ’topic’ refers to a propagation instance, with
20

Preprint
more emphasis on the topic type of the source post.) from the 198 topics collected before, ensuring
that they still cover 9 categories.
(a) RecSys ablation results on scale Normalized
RMSE, TwHIN-BERT and regular BERT show
much better performance.
(b) Recommendation results of TwHIN-BERT
and regular BERT. TwHIN-BERT can identify the
relationship between Barry Allen and The Flash
(Barry Allen is the second-generation Flash),
whereas regular BERT would not be able to
achieve this.
Figure 11: Recsys ablation results and recommendation results comparison.
w/o RecSys. In our experiments, removing the RecSys for some entertainment topics worked well
due to dense follower networks in fan groups. However, most groups lack these networks, and
removing the RecSys leads to the premature end of information spread, typically manifesting as
broadcast behavior from a single superuser. Thus, the RecSys is essential for connecting isolated
nodes and sustaining the simulation.
Different RecSys model. Pre-trained on over 7 billion posts in 100+ languages, TwHIN-BERT
is more suitable for recommendation systems than general models. Here we choose paraphrase-
MiniLM-L6-v2 and BERT-base-multilingual-cased (regular BERT) for the ablation study, we found
that TWHIN-BERT and regular BERT show much better performance than paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-
v2 in Figure 11a. Moreover, based on recommendation results in Figure 11b, TWHIN-BERT could
recommend a more proper post.
C.3 T EMPORAL FEATURE ABLATION

real propagation.

Preprint
We ablate our temporal feature (the hourly activity level extracted from the crawled data) in this ex-
periment. Specifically, we rerun the experiments of reproducing real-world information propagation
under all activity probabilities set to 1.0 and compare their Normalized RMSE on 28 topics. We can
easily see that without the temporal features, our OASIS can not capture the dynamics of real-world
information propagation well since all agents take action so frequently.
C.4 LLM A BLATION
We tried different open-sourced LLMs including Qwen1.5-7B-Chat, Internlm2-chat-20b, and
Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the backend of agents on the experiments of reproducing real-world in-
formation propagation (still on 28 topics randomly picked before).

D.3 R ECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
The recommendation system ranks all posts and saves the highest-ranked ones in a recommendation
table within the database. The size of this table can be adjusted, though it remains the same for all
users during a given experiment.
When an agent selects the refresh action, the environment server retrieves the post IDs linked to the
user’s ID from the recommendation table. A subset of these post IDs is then randomly sampled, and
the environment server queries the post table to retrieve the full content of the corresponding posts,
which are then sent to the user.
25

Preprint
The recommendation algorithm used in X can be summarized by the following formula, which
calculates the score between a post and a user.
Score = R × F × S (2)
where:
R = ln
 271.8 − (tcurrent − tcreated)
100

(3)
F = max (1, log1000(fan count + 1)) (4)
S = cosine similarity (Ep, Eu) (5)
In this context:
• R refers to the recency score.
• tcurrent represents the current timestamp.
• tcreated refers to the timestamp when the post was created.
• F refers to the fan count score.
• Ep is the embedding of the post content.
• Eu is the embedding of the user profile and recent post content.
• S refers to the cosine similarity between the embeddings Ep and Eu.
D.4 P ARALLEL OPTIMIZATION
Information Channel: During social simulations, multiple agents asynchronously and concurrently
interact with both the social media environment and the inference management servers. To facili-
tate this, the server utilizes an advanced event-driven architecture that broadens event categories to
encompass various agent actions and large model inference requests. Communications between the
agents and the servers are facilitated through a dedicated channel. This channel comprises an asyn-
chronous message queue to receive agent requests and a thread-safe dictionary for response storage.
Upon receiving a request message from an agent, the information channel automatically assigns
a UUID to ensure traceability. After processing the request, the server stores the response in the
dictionary, using the UUID as the key. See Fig.14.
Inference Manager: The manager within the inference service is capable of managing GPU de-
vices. This enables our system to flexibly scale the number of graphics cards up or down. Addi-
tionally, the manager can distribute inference requests from agents as evenly as possible across all
graphics cards for processing, thereby ensuring the efficient utilization of GPU resources.

E D ATA PREPARATIONS
E.1 R EAL -WORLD PROPAGATION DATA
We randomly select 198 propagations from Liu et al. (2015) and Ma et al. (2016), Each propagation
dataset provides the source post’s posting time, post content, and the propagation tree, with each
node containing the user ID, repost ID, and repost time. We first use the user IDs from the propa-
gation tree to retrieve the corresponding user’s profile, the following list, and previous posts. The
time period for retrieving previous posts is set to three days before the source post’s posting. It is
important to note that due to the high cost of data collection, we only collect posts from specific time
periods within these three days, such as the hour before the source post’s posting and the two hours
following the source post’s posting each day. Posts from the hour before the source post’s posting
are included in the simulation as extra noise to simulate real-world conditions better. Furthermore,
since user profiles contain only basic descriptions, we would prompt GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate
more detailed user profiles based on the user profiles and all previous posts. The recommendation
system would use this detailed profile to create a richer user representation. The prompt template is
as follows:
Generate a character description based on the following user
information:
- Name: {name}
- Username: {username}
- Description: {description}
- Account Created: {created_at}
- Followers Count: {followers_count}
- Following Count: {following_count}
- Sample of Previous Posts: {previous_posts}
Please include inferred personality traits and a summary of their
Twitter activity. Only return a short description.
Additionally, each user’s hourly activity probability within 24 hours is calculated by the following
formula:
Pij = fij
maxk(fkj ) (6)
The jth hourly activity probability of user i, Pij, is calculated by the jth hourly activity frequency
of user i, fij, divided by the maximum jth hourly activity frequency across all users in the group,
maxk(fkj ).
E.2 G ROUP POLARIZATION
In this section, we provide a detailed explanation of the principles underlying the user generation
algorithm. Due to platform constraints and the need to protect user privacy, large-scale scraping of
user data is impractical. Moreover, conventional data scraping methods fail to guarantee a realis-
tic relationship network, which could compromise the accuracy of propagation studies. To address
these challenges, we employ a relationship network generation algorithm that combines a small
amount of real user data to create a social network of up to one million users, while preserving the
scale-free nature of social networks (Barab ´asi & Albert, 1999). In this context, the user genera-
tion algorithm is the foundational data source for large-scale interactions. Our algorithm generates
diverse user profiles based on real distribution data and constructs social networks based on user
interests. Specifically:
User Profiles. To ensure the group’s diversity, we acquire population distributions from disclosed
statistics on social networks, including age and personality traits (in this experiment, we use MBTI as
a proxy). Based on authoritative statistical data, we classify professions into 13 categories and social
network trends into 9 categories, with specific categories and definitions detailed in the appendix.
27

Preprint
While ensuring scientific accuracy and diversity, we simplify the generation costs by approximat-
ing dimensions such as age, personality, and profession as independent and identically distributed
random variables. We sample from these distributions, and the large model generates the agents’
backgrounds and social characteristics based on this information. The prompt is as follows:
Please generate a social media user profile based on the provided
personal information, including a realname, username, user
bio, and a new user persona. The focus should be on creating a
fictional background story and detailed interests based on
their hobbies and profession.

"username": str, username,
"bio": str, bio,
"persona": str, user persona,
}}
Ensure the output can be directly parsed to **JSON**, do not
output anything else.
Social Network. Linking the large-scale generated agents into a relationship network is essential.
The Matthew effect observed on social platforms distinguishes core users from ordinary users; core
users on X, defined as those with more than 1000 followers, account for 80% of all users (Wojcieszak
et al., 2022). Based on this, we derive an initial core-ordinary user attention tree from core users
within specific interest areas, thereby constructing the initial relationship network. Specifically, each
agent samples twice from an independent and identically distributed interest category distribution
to obtain two topics of interest. If a topic aligns with a core user, the agent has a probability of
following that core user. To prevent an excessively dense relationship network and enhance the
diversity of information visible to various users, we establish the following probability at 0.1.
E.3 H ERD EFFECT
User Generation. In our Reddit experiment, the process of generating users is divided into three
main steps. Initially, we reference the actual demographic distribution of Reddit users (Duarte,
2024), assigning demographic information such as MBTI, age, gender, country, and profession to
each user through random sampling. Subsequently, we employ GPT-3.5 Turbo to select topics of
potential interest to the users based on the aforementioned information, choosing from seven cate-
gories: Business, Culture & Society, Economics, Fun, General News, IT, and Politics. Finally, using
demographic information and selected topics, GPT-3.5 Turbo is utilized to generate each user’s real
name, username, bio, and persona. The generation prompts for the second and third parts are as
follows.

Posts and Comments DatasetIn Experiment 3.3.2, we utilize a dataset comprising authentic Reddit
comments and llm-generated posts. In Experiment 3.4.2, we employ a counterfactual dataset to
simulate posts.
• Real Data: To align with human experiment Muchnik et al. (2013), our dataset included real
comments and post titles from 17 subreddits during March 2023 on Reddit (Pushshift, 2023).
We generate contextually relevant post content based on these titles and comments. The prompt
used for generation is as follows.
Please generate a contextual and smooth post for this comment
and notice that the comments are correct: ’{comment}’. The
response should be approximately 300 characters long and
provide relevant information or analysis. Be careful to
output the content of the post directly, and be aware that
you don’t see comments when you post. And you don’t need to
prefix something like: ’Here is your generated post:\n\n\’
Subsequently, we categorized the content from different subreddits into seven topics—Business,
Culture & Society, Economics, Fun, General News, IT, and Politics—to match the categories
used in human experiments. In total, we collected 116,932 comments. The specifics are detailed
in the table 14.

F E XPERIMENTS DETAILS
F.1 A CTIONS OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS
Due to the significant variations between different scenarios and platforms, we adjust the agents’
actions accordingly. These actions are integrated into theOASIS framework, allowing users to freely
select and combine them. The actions for different scenarios are outlined in Table 16.
F.2 I NFORMATION SPREADING
F.2.1 M ETRICS
We measure the propagation trends of messages using three key metrics: scale, depth, and max
breadth. Below is a clear definition of each measure:
• Scale: The scale of propagation corresponds to the number of unique users involved, as each
user can only repost a post once on X.
• Depth: A node’s depth is determined by the number of edges connecting it to the root node
(the original post). The overall depth of propagation is the greatest depth among all the nodes
involved.
• Max Breadth: The breadth of propagation depends on its depth, with the number of nodes at
each level representing the breadth at that specific depth. The maximum breadth is the highest
number of nodes found at any depth throughout the entire propagation.
Besides, the Normalized RMSE is computed as the following formula:
Normalized RMSE =
q
1
n
Pn
i=1
 
yi
simu − yi
real
2
yn
real
(7)
Let n refer to the maximum minute in the simulation results, and yi
simu, yi
simu represents the value of
a certain metric at the ith minute of the simulation process or the real-world propagation process.
For Normalized RMSE at every minute, since we only compute the discrepancy between the two
data points of simulation result and real propagation, the error of i-th minute can be calculated by
|yi
simu − yi
real|/yn
real.
31

Preprint
F.2.2 A LIGN WITH REAL PROPAGATIONS
In the experiment, for each propagation, we set the maximum number of time steps to 50, with each
time step representing 3 minutes in the sandbox. For action space, we only include like, repost,
follow, and do nothing, other actions are removed to simplify the settings due to the model’s limited
capacity and the inadequate real-world user data we have collected. Ultimately, we would compare
the simulation results for these 150 minutes with the propagation process in the real data for the first
150 minutes. For real-world time consumption, it takes 26 minutes to run a simulation that includes
300 agents for 30 time steps on one NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB.
Additionally, to demonstrate the reproducibility of our experiments, considering that the noise intro-
duced by posts from other users could theoretically destabilize the propagation of the source post,
we randomly select two topics: one with 33 additional posts and another with no noise. We repeat
the simulation ten times for each topic and plotted the resulting curves in a single figure to illustrate
the discrepancies across the ten simulations. The simulation results for the topic without noise are
more stable. In contrast, the results for the other topic exhibit a divergent trend, while six out of ten
experiments yield relatively concentrated results, furthermore, the degree of disturbance caused by
other posts is influenced not only by the number of posts but also by the prominence of the poster.
For instance, if a superuser from this group posts additional content, the propagation of the source
post is likely to be affected more significantly, fortunately, this situation is rare in our dataset, and
the count of additional posts is relatively small since we only consider posts created within one hour
prior to the source post’s creation time as noise. Overall, the simulation results are still relatively
stable.

(b) 10 times repeated experiments on topic with 33 additional posts.

F.4 H ERD EFFECT
F.4.1 M ETRICS
We utilized two primary metrics to assess the herd effect: the post score and the disagree score.
These metrics were derived from two aspects: the behavior of liking or disliking by the LLM Agent,
and the content of the comments it generated.
• Post Score: The score (Si) of a Reddit post is the difference between its upvotes (Ui) and down-
votes (Di), and can be negative:
Si = Ui − Di
where Si is the score of the ith post, Ui the number of upvotes, andDi the number of downvotes.
• Disagree Score: In this experiment 3.4.2, where all posts were counterfactual, we examined
comments from LLM agents at various time points. Using GPT-4o, we assessed how much
these comments disagreed with the posts. The evaluation was guided by the following prompt
template:
Someone posted a counterfactual statement: "{post_content}",
and then another person commented: "{comment_content}".
Please provide a rating from 1 to 10 to indicate how much this
person agrees with the counterfactual content, where:
1 means fully believing and agreeing with it, and 10 means
completely disbelieving and opposing it.
Respond only with a JSON object like this:
{{
"score": 7
}}
Ensure the "score" is a single integer between 1 and 10.
Before the experiment began, we randomly divided the comments data for experiment 3.3.2 and the
posts data for experiment 3.4.2 into three groups (up-treated, down-treated, and control). After the
experiment concluded, we calculated the mean post score and the 95% confidence interval of the
normal distribution for all posts in the three groups of experiment 3.3.2. Similarly, we calculated the
mean disagree score and the 95% confidence interval of the normal distribution at each time step
for all comments associated with posts in the three groups of experiment 3.4.2.
F.4.2 S ETTING DETAILS
Comparison with the Herd Effect in Humans. Our experiment 3.3.2 replicated the setup of a
human study, including the visibility of comment scores (upvotes minus downvotes) and prohibiting
the revocation of likes and dislikes, utilizing Reddit’s popularity-based recommendation algorithm.
To minimize biases stemming from the identities of commenters and voters and their interactions,
which were meticulously accounted for in the human experiments, we manipulated a specific user to
post content at scheduled intervals. This approach was adopted to mitigate the influence of different
34

Preprint
posters on the behavior of agents, and we further circumvented the impact of relationships with
specific posting users on the outcomes by prohibiting agents from following or muting operations.
Consequently, the action space for the experiment included actions: like comment, dislike comment,
like post, dislike post, search posts, search users, trend, refresh, and do nothing. The controlled
user generated 200 posts at each time step, with each post accompanied by 1-10 comments. The
recommendation system cached the top 300 posts with the highest heat scores for each agent, and
each agent had a 0.1 probability of activation at every time step. Activated agents would randomly
sample one of these 300 posts to read during that time step. The experiment was conducted over a
total of 40 time steps.
Herd Effect Towards Counterfactual Content. The action space of the experiment 3.4.2 in-
cludes create comment, like comment, dislike comment, like post, dislike post, search posts, search
users, trend, refresh, and do nothing. Each agent has a 0.1 probability of activation at each time step,
and each activated agent will randomly sample 5 posts from the recommended cache to read during
that time step. As the number of agents increases from 100, 1k to 10k, the number of posts cached
by the recommendation system respectively becomes 50, 500, and 5000. The controlled user creates
30, 300, 3k posts at each time step, respectively, until all posts in the corresponding datasets (with
219, 2191, and 21919 posts, respectively) have been created. And the experiment was conducted
over a total of 30 time steps.
F.4.3 E XAMPLES OF RESULTS
In experiment 3.4.2, 10,000 agents were able to discuss their views on counterfactual posts in the
comment section, interacting by posting their own comments or by liking or disliking others’ com-
ments. Over the course of the discussion, there was a gradual shift towards opposing the counter-
factual content, achieving factual correction at the group level. The figure 16 below shows one such
example.

H LIMITATIONS & FUTURE DIRECTIONS
RecSys The current recommendation system is only designed at a high level similar to platforms
like X (formerly Twitter) or Reddit. For example, the RecSys designed following X’s model only
recommends semantically similar posts based on the user’s profile and recent activity. More complex
recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, have not been implemented in OASIS,
leading to a misalignment between OASIS’s performance and real-world propagation data.
User Generation Whether we obtain user data through the Twitter API or the User Generation
algorithm proposed in OASIS, both approaches abstract the real individual to some extent, leading
to a natural gap between our simulator and the real world.
Social Media Platform Although we have expanded the action space on social media platforms to
a considerable extent, not all possible actions are covered. For example, our platform currently does
not support features like bookmarking, tipping, purchasing, or live streaming, which could be added
in future work. Additionally, the current simulation operates solely in a text-based environment,
meaning agents are unable to perceive images, videos, or audio. Future extensions could incorporate
multimodal content to enhance the realism of the simulation.
Scalable Design While our asynchronous design helps to avoid bottlenecks, simulating millions
of agents still requires several days to complete. Optimizing inference speed and improving the
efficiency of database systems will be critical in reducing time and cost, making large-scale social
simulations more feasible for widespread applications in the future.
Untapped Potential Our large-scale social simulation platform has the potential to serve as a
foundational environment for other research. For instance, it can be used to evaluate the performance
of novel recommendation systems or to train large language models (LLMs) with enhanced influence
capabilities, using feedback from other agents in the network as a reward signal.
36

Preprint
I S OCIAL IMPACT AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The development and application ofOASIS provide valuable insights into complex social phenomena
such as information propagation, group polarization, and herd effects. However, this also raises
important ethical considerations. First, the replication of real-world social dynamics using large
language model (LLM) agents introduces concerns regarding the fidelity and interpretation of the
results. The risk of reinforcing biases, especially in areas related to misinformation or polarization,
could exacerbate real-world issues if not properly managed. Researchers using OASIS must be
cautious in how these simulations influence public understanding or policy recommendations.
Another key concern is privacy. While OASIS is designed to replicate social media environments,
the use of real-world data for training agents may introduce risks related to user anonymity and
data security. Ensuring the ethical handling of any real-world datasets, including anonymization and
consent, is crucial.
Lastly, the scalability of OASIS, while an asset for research, also presents potential dangers if mis-
used. Large-scale agent-based models, particularly those that simulate millions of users, could be
leveraged for unethical purposes such as manipulation of online discourse or misinformation cam-
paigns. It is therefore essential to implement strict governance and ethical guidelines to prevent
misuse of the simulator’s capabilities.
