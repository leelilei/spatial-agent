Agent-based modeling has been around for decades, and applied widely across the social and natural
sciences. The scope of this research method is now poised to grow dramatically as it absorbs the new
affordances provided by Large Language Models (LLM)s. Generative Agent-Based Models (GABM) are
not just classic Agent-Based Models (ABM)s where the agents talk to one another. Rather, GABMs
are constructed using an LLM to apply common sense to situations, act “reasonably”, recall common
semantic knowledge, produce API calls to control digital technologies like apps, and communicate
both within the simulation and to researchers viewing it from the outside. Here we present Concordia,
a library to facilitate constructing and working with GABMs. Concordia makes it easy to construct
language-mediated simulations of physically- or digitally-grounded environments. Concordia agents
produce their behavior using a flexible component system which mediates between two fundamental
operations: LLM calls and associative memory retrieval. A special agent called the Game Master (GM),
which was inspired by tabletop role-playing games, is responsible for simulating the environment where
the agents interact. Agents take actions by describing what they want to do in natural language. The
GM then translates their actions into appropriate implementations. In a simulated physical world, the
GM checks the physical plausibility of agent actions and describes their effects. In digital environments
simulating technologies such as apps and services, the GM may handle API calls to integrate with external
tools such as general AI assistants (e.g., Bard, ChatGPT), and digital apps (e.g., Calendar, Email, Search,
etc.). Concordia was designed to support a wide array of applications both in scientific research and for
evaluating performance of real digital services by simulating users and/or generating synthetic data.

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
1. Introduction
Agent-based social simulation is used through-
out the social and natural sciences (e.g. Poteete
et al. (2010)). Historically, Agent-Based Model-
ing (ABM) methods have mostly been applied at
a relatively abstract level of analysis, and this
has limited their usefulness. For instance, in-
sights from behavioral economics and related
fields which study how people actually make deci-
sions are rarely combined with ideas from institu-
tional and resource economics in the same model
despite the fact that integrating these two bodies
of knowledge is thought to be critical for building
up the full picture of how social-ecological sys-
tems function, and how interventions may help
or hinder their governance (Schill et al., 2019).
Now, using generative AI1, it is possible to con-
structanewgenerationofABMswheretheagents
not only have a richer set of cognitive operations
available for adaptive decision making but also
communicate with one another in natural lan-
guage.
Here we propose Generative Agent-Based Mod-
els (GABM)s, which are much more flexible and
expressive than ABMs, and as a result can incor-
porate far more of the complexity of real social
situations. Applying generative models within
agents gives them common sense (imperfectly
but still impressively) (Zhao et al., 2023), rea-
soning (Huang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022),
planning (Song et al., 2023), few-shot learn-
ing (Brown et al., 2020; Bubeck et al., 2023),
and common ground with one another e.g in un-
derstanding the meanings of words. Generative
agents may be able to reason appropriately from
premises to conclusions much of the time, and
are typically able to predict the actions of oth-
ers (Agüera y Arcas and Norvig, 2023; Bubeck
et al., 2023). They also possess substantial cul-
tural knowledge and can be prompted to “role
play” as simulated members of specific human
subpopulations (Argyle et al., 2023; Safdari et al.,
2023; Shanahan et al., 2023).
Concordia is a library to facilitate construction
and use of GABMs to simulate interactions of
1such as Anil et al. (2023); OpenAI (2023); Touvron et al.
(2023); Workshop et al. (2022).
agents in grounded physical, social, or digital
space. It makes it easy and flexible to define envi-
ronments using an interaction pattern borrowed
from tabletop role-playing games in which a spe-
cial agent called the Game Master (GM) is re-
sponsible for simulating the environment where
player agents interact (like a narrator in an inter-
active story). Agents take actions by describing
what they want to do in natural language. The
GM then translates their actions into appropriate
implementations. In a simulated physical world
the GM checks the physical plausibility of agent
actions and describes their effects. In general,
the GM can use any existing modeling technique
to simulate the non-linguistic parts of the simu-
lation (e.g. physical, chemical, digital, financial,
etc). In digital environments involving software
technologies, the GM may even connect with real
apps and services by formatting the necessary API
calls to integrate with external tools (as in Schick
et al. (2023)). In the examples provided with the
library we demonstrate how Concordia can be
used to simulate a small town election, a small
business, a dispute over a damaged property, a so-
cialpsychologyexperiment, andasocialplanning
scenario mediated through a digital app (see A.8
for details).
Validation. For a GABM to be useful we need
some reason to trust that the results obtained
with it may generalize to real human social life.
Many aspects of model validation concern both
GABMs and other kinds of ABMs (see Windrum
et al. (2007)), while GABMs also raise new is-
sues. While still surely a debatable point, we do
think there will be some yet to be identified set
of conditions under which we may gain a reason-
able level of confidence that a model’s predictions
will generalize. Therefore we think identifying
them should be highest priority right now for
this nascent field (see also Dillion et al. (2023);
Grossmann et al. (2023)).
There are no panaceas in model validation.
GABMs constructed for different purposes call for
validation by different forms of evidence. For ex-
ample, many GABMs employ experiment designs
featuring an intervention, which may involve ei-
ther intervening on internal variables affecting
3

the cognition of an individual, e.g. “how does ru-
mination work?”, or on external factors affecting
the environment in which individuals interact,
e.g. how are property rights implemented? De-
pendent outcome variables may be on the indi-
vidual level, e.g. questionnaire responses, or on
the societal level e.g. equality, sustainability, etc.
WhenaGABMshowsthroughsuchanexperiment
that A causes B (in the model) we may regard it
as a prediction that A causes B in the real world
too. Sometimes this prediction is meant at a rela-
tivelydetailedquantitativelevel(e.g.iftheGABM
was built in a way that incorporates substantial
empirical data), while other times (more often)
it would be intended as a statement either about
a mechanism which may exist in real life or a pre-
diction concerning the likely effect of something
we may do in real life (such as to make a public
policy change or deploy a technology). A GABM
is said to generalize when inferences made on
the basis of the model transfer to real life.
In evidence-based medicine and evidence-
based policy making researchers are trained to
consider an explicit hierarchy of evidence when
evaluating the effect of interventions (Higgins
etal.,2008). Wemayenvisionitlikealadderwith
highest rungs corresponding to the best evidence
and lowest rungs corresponding to poor evidence.
Evidence of effectiveness in real life (ecological
validity) is at the top, rigorous experiments in
controlled settings like labs or clinics below that,
observational data lower down, and consistency
with prior theory lower still. For validation, it
also matters what the model will be used for. If it
will only be used to guide decisions about where
one may most fruitfully focus time, effort, and re-
sources in further research (e.g., in piloting) then
the evidence bar should be correspondingly lower
than if the model is to be used to guide real world
decisions with real consequences. Importantly,
it is not really correct to speak of evidence for
or against a theory. Theories can only really be
judged by their “productivity”, i.e. the extent to
which they motivate new work building on them
further, especially new empirical research in real
life (Lakatos, 1970). We discuss the hierarchy of
evidence further in Section 2.3.
Digital media. In order to build models of con-
temporary social phenomena it is important to
consider the substantial role the digital medium
plays in modern communication and other activi-
ties, as well as how it shapes human interactions
and decisions (Risse, 2023). Therefore, Concor-
dia makes it possible to represent digital compo-
nents such as apps, social networks, and general
AI assistants within the simulation environment.
Thisiscriticalsincethemediumthroughwhichin-
formationistransmittedisnotpassivebutactively
shapes the nature and impact of the message.
Each medium has its own unique qualities, and
thosequalitieshaveatransformativeimpactonso-
ciety, culture, and individuals (McLuhan, 2017).
For instance, the recommender algorithms used
insocialmediahaveasubstantialeffectonhuman
culture and society and the fact that LLM-based
systems have analogous properties, affecting both
how information is transmitted and how it is val-
ued, implies they are likely to influence human
culture and society more and more as time goes
on (Brinkmann et al., 2023). By integrating digi-
tal elements into simulations, we aim to facilitate
research that seeks to capture these qualities and
the way they shape culture and society.
Moreover, the digital representation can have
various degrees of abstraction from natural lan-
guage prompting, via mock-up implementation
to integration with real external services (e.g. by
calling real APIs with generated text as in Schick
et al. (2023)). The latter has great importance in
enabling sandbox evaluation of real services with
social agents, generating realistic data, as well as
in evaluating real services.
These simulation techniques can also address
the challenges of evaluating digital apps and gen-
eral AI assistants (e.g., Bard, ChatGPT) in user-
centric and intricate scenarios that demand the
fulfillment of multiple constraints. Take, for in-
stance, personal AI assistants that are designed
to adapt to user preferences and respond to their
requests. In such situations, the objective is in-
tricate, rooted in satisfying a range of implicit
and explicit constraints. It would be difficult to
optimize without large amounts of natural data.
Agent-based simulation can be used to generate
synthetic data trails of agent activities to use in

the absence of (and also in conjunction with) real
data sources. This synthetic data may be use-
ful both for training and evaluating models, as
well as for simulating and analyzing the perfor-
mance of scenario-specific interactions between
an agent and an actual service. These proposed
applications offer a viable alternative to tradi-
tional, human-centric methods, which are often
expensive, not scalable, and less capable of han-
dling such complex tasks.
Foundation models are poised to be transfor-
mative for agent-based social simulation method-
ology in the social and natural sciences. However,
as with any large affordance change, research
best-practices are currently in flux. There is no
consensus at present concerning how to interpret
results of LLM-based simulations of human popu-
lations. Thecriticalepistemicquestionis“bywhat
standard should we judge whether (and in what
ways, and under which conditions) the results
of in silico experiments are likely to generalize
to the real world?”. These are not questions any
one group of researchers can answer by them-
selves; rather these issues must be negotiated by
the community as a whole.
Concordia is an open invitation to the scientific
community to participate in the creation of epis-
temic norms and best practices of GABM. We are
releasing the library together with a few illustra-
tive examples and intend to update it with new
features and experiments. We will be reviewing
and accepting contributions on regular basis.
Concordia requires access to a standard LLM
API, and optionally may also integrate with real
applications and services.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows.
The following section 2 gives an overview of the
Concordia library and how to design experiments
in it. Section 3 presents several ways the Concor-
dia agents and experiments can be interpreted.
We discuss applications in section 4. Appendix A
contains implementation details.
Concordia is available on GitHub2.

Like other agent-based modeling approaches, a
generative model of social interactions (i.e. a
GABM) consists of two parts: the model of the en-
vironment and the model of individual behavior.
In this case both are generative. Thus we have:

interaction i.e. the environment, space, or world
where the interaction takes place. We call the
model responsible for the environment the Game
Master (GM). Both this name and the approach
it reflects were inspired by table-top role-playing
gameslikeDungeonsandDragonswhereaplayer
called the Game Master takes the role of the sto-
ryteller (Gygax and Cook, 1989). In these games,
players interact with one another and with non-
player characters in a world invented and main-
tained by the GM.
Concordia agents consume observations and
produce actions. The GM consumes agent actions
and createsevent statements, which define what
has happened in the simulation as a result of the
agent’s attempted action. Figure 1 illustrates this
setup. The GM also creates and sends observa-
tions to agents. Observations, actions and event
statements are all strings in English. The GM is
also responsible for maintaining and updating
grounded variables, advancing the clock and run-
ning the episode loop.
Concordia agents generate their behavior by
describing what they intend to do in natural
language—e.g.“Alexmakesbreakfast”. Thegame
master takes their intended actions, decides on
theoutcomeoftheirattempt, andgeneratesevent
statements. The GM is responsible for:
1. Maintaining a consistent and grounded state
of the world where agents interact with each
other.
2. Communicating the observable state of the
world to the agents.
3. Deciding the effect of agents’ actions on the
world and each other.
4. Resolving what happens when actions sub-
mitted by multiple agents conflict with one
another.
The most important responsibility of the GM
is to provide the grounding for particular exper-
imental variables, which are defined on a per-
experiment basis. The GM determines the effect
of the agents’ actions on these variables, records
them, and checks that they are valid. Whenever
an agent tries to perform an action that violates
thegrounding, itcommunicatestothemthattheir
action was invalid. For example, in an economic
simulation the amount of money in an agent’s
possession may be a grounded variable. The GM
would track whether agents gained or lost money

on each step and perhaps prevent them from pay-
ing more than they have available.
One may configure the specific set of grounded
variables to use on a per-experiment basis. This
flexible functionality is critical because different
research applications require different variables.
You can take a look at an example output
of one of our experiments (see the Concordia
GitHub repo), which was simulating elections in
a small town, where some agents are running for

against a candidate.
2.1. Generative agents
Simulated agent behavior should be coherent
with common sense, guided by social norms, and
individually contextualized according to a per-
sonal history of past events as well as ongoing
perception of the current situation.
March and Olsen (2011) posit that humans
generally act as though they choose their actions
by answering three key questions:
1. What kind of situation is this?
2. What kind of person am I?
3. WhatdoesapersonsuchasIdoinasituation
such as this?
Our hypothesis is that since modern LLMs have
been trained on massive amounts of human cul-
ture they are thus capable of giving satisfactory
(i.e. reasonably realistic) answers to these ques-
tions when provided with the historical context of
a particular agent. The idea is that, if the outputs
of LLMs conditioned to simulate specific human
sub-populations reflect the beliefs and attitudes
of those subpopulations as argued in work such
as Argyle et al. (2023) then this approach to im-
plementing generative agents should yield agents
thatcanreasonablybesaidtomodelhumanswith
some level of fidelity. Safdari et al. (2023) have
also found out that personality measurements in
the outputs of some LLMs under specific prompt-
ingconfigurationsarereliableandvalid,therefore
generativeagentscouldbeusedtomodelhumans
with diverse psychological profiles. In some cases
answering the key questions might require com-
mon sense reasoning and / or planning, which
LLMs do show capacity for (Huang et al., 2022;
Song et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022; Zhao et al.,
2023), and show similar biases in behavioral eco-
nomicsexperimentsashumans(Aheretal.,2023;
Brand et al., 2023; Horton, 2023). The ability of
LLMs to learn ‘in-context’ and zero-shot Brown
et al. (2020); Bubeck et al. (2023); Dong et al.
(2022); OpenAI (2023) reinforces the hypothe-
sis further—the agent might be able to ascertain
what is expected of them in the current situation
from a demonstration or an example.
For an LLM to be able to answer the key ques-
tions, it must be provided with a record of an
agent’s historical experience. However, simply
listing every event that happened in an agent’s
life would overwhelm the LLM (it would not fit
in the context window). Therefore we follow the
approach of Park et al. (2023) and use an as-
sociative memory to keep the record of agents
experience. Concordia makes it easy to design
generative agents in a modular fashion. Our ap-
proach was inspired by Park et al. (2023), but
designed to be more flexible and modular.
Concordia agents dynamically construct the
text that conditions the LLM call they use to se-
lect their course of action on each timestep. The
context-generation process is factorized into a set
of components. Components serve as intermedi-
aries between long-term memories of experience
and the relatively compact conditioning text used
to generate action. Intuitively, the set of compo-
nents used in an agent comprise its “society of
mind” (Minsky, 1988), where each component
focuses on a certain aspect of the agent or its cir-
cumstances which are relevant to generating its
current choice of action. For example, if we are

memory be a set of stringsm that records every-
thing remembered or currently experienced by
the agent. The working memory isz = {𝑧𝑖}𝑖 is
composed of the states of individual components
(Figure 2). A component𝑖 has a state𝑧𝑖, which
is statement in natural language—e.g. “Alice is
at work”. The components update their states by
querying the memory (which contains the incom-
ing observations) and using LLM for summarising
and reasoning. Components can also condition
their update on the current state of other com-
ponents. For example, the planning component
can update its state if an incoming observation
invalidates the current plan, conditioned on the
state of the ‘goal’ component. Components can
also have internal logic programmed using classic
programming, for example a hunger component
can check how many calories an agent consumed
and how recently it consumed them, and update
its state based on the result.
We use the same associative memory architec-
ture as in Park et al. (2023)3. We feed the in-
3The idea of simulating a group of generative agents has
been explored in a variety of ways in recent work. Our
work is focused on on agent-based modeling for science and
for evaluation of digital technologies. Another recent line
of work has focused instead on the idea of using groups
of generative agents to simulate organizations that solve
coming observations immediately into the agents
memory, to make them available when compo-
nents update4.
When creating a generative agent in Concordia,
the user creates the components that are relevant
for their simulations. They decide on the initial
state and the update function. The components
are then supplied to the agents constructor.
Formally, the agent is defined as a two step
sampling process, using a LLM𝑝 (see Figure 3 for
illustration). In the action step, the agent samples
its activity 𝑎𝑡, given the state of componentsz𝑡 =
{𝑧𝑖
𝑡}𝑖:
𝑎𝑡 ∼ 𝑝(·| 𝑓 𝑎(z𝑡)) (1)
Here 𝑓 𝑎 is a formatting function, which cre-
ates out of the states of components the context
used to sample the action to take. The most sim-
ple form of 𝑓 𝑎 is a concatenation operator over
z𝑡 = {𝑧𝑖
𝑡}𝑖. We do not explicitly condition on the
memory m or observation 𝑜, since we can sub-
problems like software companies and to thereby try to
build a general-purpose problem solving system (Hong et al.,
2023; Li et al., 2023b).
4For convenience, we also allow the components to sub-
scribe to the observation stream explicitly.

sume them into components. First, we can im-
mediately addo𝑡 to the memorym𝑡 = m𝑡−1 ∪ o𝑡.
Unlike RL, we do not assume that the agent re-
sponds with an action to every observation. The
agent can get several observations before it acts,
therefore o𝑡 is a set of strings. Then we can setz0
to be the component that incorporates the latest
observations and relevant memories into its state.
This allows us to exclusively use the vehicle of
components to define the agent.
In the second step the agent samples its state
z, given the agents memorym𝑡 up to the present
time:
z𝑖
𝑡+1 ∼ 𝑝(·| 𝑓 𝑖 (z𝑡, m𝑡)) . (2)
Here, 𝑓 𝑖 is a formatting function that turns the
memory stream and the current state of the com-
ponents into the query for the component update.
We explicitly condition on the memory streamm,
since a component may make specific queries into
the agent’s memory to update its state. Here eq.2
updates components after every action, but gener-
ally, itisuptotheagenttodecideatwhatcadence
to update each of its components. It is reasonable
to update some components less frequently for
efficiency or longer term consistency.
Notice how eq.1 and eq.2 are not fundamen-
tally different. What makes the difference be-
tween an agent output and a component is that
the output of the former is interpreted by the GM
as an action in the environment. In eq.1 we also
don’t explicitly condition on the memory to point
out the architectural decision, where components
mediate between a long-term memory and the
agents working memory. Otherwise, we can think
of an agent as a special kind of component and
of components as sub-agents.
2.2. Generative environments
RL research was fuelled by the availability of
complex games, where the agents can be tested,
trained and evaluated (Bellemare et al., 2013;
Jaderberg et al., 2019; Vinyals et al., 2019). Here
we take an inspiration from table top role playing
games like Dungeons and Dragons (Gygax and
Cook, 1989). In these games players collabora-
tively generate a story, while using rules, dice,
pen and paper to ground it—for example, players
have to keep their health points above zero to
avoid death.
The GM is responsible for all aspects of the
simulated world not directly controlled by the
agents. The GM mediates between the state of
the world and agents’ actions. The state of the
world is contained in GM’s memory and the val-
ues of grounded variables (e.g. money, posses-
sions, votes, etc.). To achieve this the GM has to
repeatedly answer the following questions:
1. What is the state of the world?
2. Given the state of the world, what event is
the outcome of the players activity?
3. What observation do players make of the
event?
4. What effect does the event have on grounded
variables?
The GM is implemented in a similar fashion to
a generative agent. Like agents, the GM has an
associative memory similar to Park et al. (2023)’s
proposal. Like agents, the GM is implemented
using components. However, instead of contex-
tualizing action selection, the components of the
GM describe the state of the world—for example
location and status of players, state of grounded
variables (money, important items) and so on–
—so that GM can decide the event that happens
astheoutcomeofplayers’actions. Theoutcomeis
described in theevent statement(e.g. “Alice went
to the grocery store and met Bob in the cereal
aisle”), which is then added to the GM associative
memory. After the event has been decided the
GM elaborates on its consequences. For example,
the event could have changed the value of one of
the grounded variables or it could have had an
effect on a non-acting player. Figure 1 illustrates
this process.
The GM generates an event statement 𝑒𝑡 in
response to each agent action:
𝑒𝑡 ∼ 𝑝(·| 𝑓 𝑒(z𝑡), 𝑎𝑡) (3)
Here we explicitly condition on the action at-
tempted by the agent, although it could be sub-
sumed into the components (like observation in
9

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
eq.1). This is to highlight that the GM generates
an event statement𝑒𝑡 in response to every action
ofanyagent,whiletheagentmighttakeinseveral
observations before it acts (or none at all). After
adding the event statement𝑒𝑡 to its memory the
GM can update its components using the same
eq. 2 as the agent. It can then emit observations
o𝑖
𝑡 for player𝑖 using the following equation:
o𝑖
𝑡+1 ∼ 𝑝(·| 𝑓 𝑜(z𝑡+1)) (4)
In case the GM judges that a player did not ob-
serve the event, no observation is emitted. Notice
that the components can have their internal logic
written using any existing modelling tools (ODE,
graphical models, finite state machines, etc.) and
thereforecanbringknownmodelsofcertainphys-
ical, chemical or financial phenomena into the
simulation.
2.3. Experiment design using Concordia
An experiment is a specific configuration of the
agents and the GM, which models a certain kind
of social interaction. For example, an experi-
ment that models a small business would have a
grounded variable that accounts for money and
goods to be exchanged between agents. An ex-
periment modeling local elections in a small town
would have grounded variables accounting for
votes and voting procedures. An experiment mod-
eling resource governance by a local community,
e.g. a lobster fishery, may have grounded vari-
ables reflecting the state of the resource as well
as financial and political variables.
The experimenter would then control some (in-
dependent) variables affecting either the GM or
the agents and observe the effect of their inter-
vention on outcome variables. Outcomes of inter-
est may be psychological and per-agent, e.g. re-
sponses to questionnaires, or global variables per-
taining to the simulation as a whole such as the
amount of trade or the average price of goods.
The basic principle of model validation is one of
similarity between tested and untested samples.
A model typically makes a family of related pre-
dictions, and perhaps a rigorous experiment tests
only one of them. Nevertheless, if the untested
predictions are sufficiently similar to the tested
prediction then one might also gain some confi-
dence in the untested predictions. The key ques-
tion here is how similar is similar enough.
We can articulate some concrete recommenda-
tions for best practices in generative agent-based
modeling:
1. Measure generalization—Direct measure-
ment of model predictions on truly new test
data that could not have influenced either
the model’s concrete parameters or its ab-
stract specification is the gold standard. For
instance, when a model makes predictions
about how humans will behave in certain
situation then there is no better form of evi-
dence than actually measuring how real peo-
ple behave when facing the modeled situa-
tion. If the prediction concerns the effect of
an intervention, then one would need to run
the experiment in real life (or find a natu-
ral experiment that has not already contami-
nated the model’s training data). However,
it is important to remember that direct evi-
dence of generalization trumps other forms
of evidence.
2. Evaluate algorithmic fidelity—a validity
concept developed recently for research on
human behavior using data sampled using
generative AI (Argyle et al., 2023). Algorith-
mic fidelity describes the extent to which
a model may be conditioned using socio-
demographic backstories to simulate specific
human groups (or stereotypes of them, see
unsolved issues below). Note however that
it’s unlikely that algorithmic fidelity would
be uniform over diverse research topics or
parts of human lived experience. Any partic-
ular LLM will be better at simulating some
people over other people (Atari et al., 2023),
and will work better for some applications
than others. Argyle et al. (2023) conclude
from this that algorithmic fidelity must be
measured anew for each research question.
A finding of sufficient algorithmic fidelity
to address one research question does not
imply the same will be true for others (see
also Amirova et al. (2023); Santurkar et al.
(2023)).
3. Model comparison—It is a lot easier to
10

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
support the claim that one model is better
(i.e. more trustworthy) than another model
than to support the claim that either model
is trustworthy on an absolute scale without
reference to the other.
4. Robustness—It will be important to try to
develop standardized sensitivity analysis /
robustness-checking protocols. For instance,
it’s known that LLMs are often quite sensitive
to the precise wording used in text prompts.
Best practices for GABMs should involve sam-
pling from a distribution of “details” and
ways of asking questions to show that the
factors not thought to be mechanistically re-
lated to the outcome are indeed as irrelevant
as expected. Keep in mind that no amount of
sensitivity analysis can substitute for a test
of generalization.
5. A useful slogan to keep in mind is that one
shouldtry to make the minimal number of
maximally general modeling choices. This
is a kind of parsimony principle for genera-
tive agent-based modeling. Obeying it does
not guarantee a model will generalize; nev-
ertheless failure to follow it does often doom
generalization since models that are more
complex are usually also more brittle, and
models that are more brittle generally fail to
generalize.
While generalization data is the gold standard,
it is often difficult, unethical, or simply impossible
to obtain. Therefore the hierarchy of evidence for
validating GABMs also includes lower rungs cor-
responding to weaker forms of evidence. These
include:
1. Consistency with prior theory—i.e. check-
ing coherence with predictions of other the-
oretical traditions. For instance, evidence
for the validity of a GABM modeling con-
sumer behavior could be obtained by show-
ing that prices in the model move in ways
predicted by classic microeconomic theories
of downward-sloping price-quantity demand
curves. It is possible to directly evaluate
counterfactuals andceteris paribusstipula-
tions in many kinds of model. As a result, it
is often simple to test a model’s consistency
with a causal theory in a very direct way5.
2. Low similarity between validating obser-
vations and desired application. How low
is too low? Some populations are just very
hard to reach by researchers, but some of
these populations are very much online. For
example individuals with low generalized
trust do not pick up the phone to pollsters
and do not sign up for experiments. Nev-
ertheless there are millions of such people,
and they do use the internet. It’s likely that
an LLM trained on large amounts of data
from the internet would absorb some level
of understanding of such groups. In such
cases where it is difficult to recruit real par-
ticipants, adopting a more flexible approach
to validating GABMs representing such pop-
ulations may be the best that can be done.
Several unsolved issues impacting validity in
ways specific to ABMs that incorporate generative
AI like Concordia are as follows. For now it is
unclear how to resolve them.
1. Train-testcontamination—thisisespecially
an issue with regard to academic papers. For
instance, it’s not valid to simply ask an LLM
toplayPrisoner’sDilemma. LLMshave“read”
countless papers on the topic and that expe-
rience surely affects how they respond. How-
ever, many researchers are of the opinion
that such an experiment may be conducted
in a valid way if the interpretation of the sit-
uation as Prisoner’s Dilemma is somewhat
hidden. So instead of describing a situation
with prisoners you make up a different story
to justify the same incentives. This issue was
also discussed in Aher et al. (2023), espe-
cially appendix F, see also Ullman (2023).
2. LLMs likely represent stereotypes of hu-
mangroups (Weidinger et al., 2021). There-
fore we may inadvertently study stereotypes
ofpeoplenottheirreallivedexperience. This
problem may be exacerbated for minority
groups.

specific individual?
3. Interpretations
Concordia is not opinionated as to how you in-
terpret the experiments and models you use it to
construct. However, since generative agent-based
modeling is quite different from other modeling
techniques, we have found it helpful to explore
the following interpretations, both for conceptu-
alizing it to ourselves and explaining it to others.
3.1. Neuroscience interpretation of the gener-
ative agent architecture
Generative agents such as those in Concordia and
in Park et al. (2023) are biologically plausible de-
scriptions of the brain, at some level of analysis.
They foreground a specific picture of cognition
as a whole, which has not been especially promi-
nent in the past despite its having considerable
empirical support.
Recent experimental (Goldstein et al., 2022;
Schrimpf et al., 2020) and theoretical (Linzen
and Baroni, 2021; McClelland et al., 2020) work
in computational cognitive (neuro-)science has
posited a deep relationship between the opera-
tions of LLM models and how language is pro-
cessed by the human brain. For instance, brain-
to-brain coupling of neural activity between a
speaker and listener (as measured by electrocor-
ticography) may be accounted for by LLM fea-
tures reflecting conversation context (Goldstein
et al., 2022). Representations appear first in the
speaker before articulation and then reemerge af-
ter articulation in the listener (Zada et al., 2023).
The brain certainly appears to sample what it
will say next in such a way as to complete any
pattern it has started. This is how we can start
speaking without knowing in advance how we
will finish. There is more concrete evidence for
this pattern completion view of behavior from
split brain patients (patients whose brain hemi-
spheres have been surgically disconnected as a
treatment for epilepsy). For instance, you can
present a reason for action to their left eye (i.e.
their right brain), it then prompts them to start
performing the action with their left hand. And
simultaneously present some other information
to their right eye (left brain). Next ask them in
language why they are doing it (i.e. ask their left
brain, since language is lateralized). The result
is that they make up a reason consistent with
whatever information was presented to their left
brain. Split brain patients typically express confi-
dence in these confabulated (made up) reasons
for action (Roser and Gazzaniga, 2004).
A Concordia agent has both a long-term mem-
ory and a working memory. The long-term mem-
ory is a set of sequences of symbols. The working
memory is a single sequence of symbols. The con-
tents of working memory are always in the con-
ditioning set for the next-symbol prediction used
to construct the agent’s action sequence. At each
decision point, a neural network performs incre-
mental next-symbol prediction, starting from the
contents of working memoryz𝑡, eventually pro-
ducing an articulatory symbol sequence𝑎𝑡 to emit
(i.e. for downstream motor circuitry to read out
as speech). Information formatted as sequences
of symbols gets in to working memory in one of
two ways: either a sequence of symbols may be
evokeddirectlyfromthecurrentstimulus,oralter-
natively a sequence of symbols may be retrieved
from long-term memory. A range of different per-
ceptual mechanisms and retrieval mechanisms
are jointly responsible for getting all the relevant
information needed for the agent to produce an
effectiveactionsequenceintoitsworkingmemory
(e.g. as in Park et al. (2023)).
To implement routine behavior, an agent could
continually rehearse its routine in working mem-
ory, but that would impair its ability to use work-
ing memory for other purposes on other tasks
since its working memory is limited in capac-
ity (like in Baddeley (1992)). So instead of
continually rehearsing routines in working mem-
ory, we may instead assume that they are often
storedelsewhereandthenretrievedwhenneeded
(i.e. from long-term memory).
As a result of being stored in a natural lan-
guage representation, explicit routines are some-
what fragile. They may be hard to recall, and
frequently forgotten if not used. When a routine
12

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
is not practiced often enough there is a risk of
it being forgotten. Luckily, explicit routines may
also be written down on paper (or stone tablets),
and kept permanently.
A generative agent may also actas ifit makes
its decisions under guidance of an explicit routine
while not actually being conditioned on any lin-
guistic representation of that routine. This hap-
pens when the routine exists implicitly in the
weights of the LLM’s neural network. Unlike ex-
plicit routines, such implicitly coded routines may
not be precisely articulable in natural language.
For instance, one may follow the rule of “avoid-
ing obscenity” without being able to precisely
articulate what obscenity is. In fact, Obscenity is
famously so difficult to precisely define that US
Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart could offer
only the classification “I know it when I see it”.
Concordia agents can capture such recognition-
mediated behavior by using fine-tuning to modify
the LLM as needed.
3.2. A theory of social construction
"Situations, organizations, and
environments are talked into existence"
Weick et al. (2005)
In social construction theories, agents may
change their environment through the collective
effects of their actions on social structures like
norms, roles, and institutions which together de-
termine most of what matters about any given so-
cial situation. Furthermore, changes in the social
structures constituting the environment deeply
change the agents’ own “internal” models and
categories (Wendt, 1992). Causal influence flows
both from agents to social structures as well as
from social structures to agents. Groups of agents
may take collective action to change norms or in-
stitutions (Sunstein, 2019), and simultaneously
social structures may influence agents by setting
out the “rules of the game” in which they select
their actions (Wendt, 1987). Agents and struc-
tures may be said toco-constitute one another
(Onuf, 1989).
The key questions of March and Olsen (2011),
which we introduced in Section 2.1, were derived
from a social constructionist conception of how
agents make decisions. It posits that humans
generally act as though they choose their actions
by answering three key questions. People may
construct parts of their understanding of “what
kind of person am I?” on the basis of their mem-
ory of their past behavior via logic such as “I do
this often, so I must like to do it” (Ouellette and
Wood, 1998). Likewise, “what kind of situation
is this?” is usually informed by culturally defined
categories like institutions, e.g. this is a classroom
and I am in the role of the professor. And, “what
does a person such as I do in a situation such as
this?” may be answered by recalling examples
to mind of people fitting certain social roles in
similar situations and the way they behaved in
them (Harris et al., 2021; Sunstein, 1996).
Since modern LLMs have been trained on mas-
sive amounts of human culture they thus may be
capable of giving satisfactory answers to these
questions when provided with the right con-
text to create a specific agent. This approach
relies on the extent to which the outputs of
LLMs conditioned to simulate specific human sub-
populations actually reflect the beliefs and at-
titudes of those subpopulations. Argyle et al.
(2023) termed this property of some LLMsal-
gorithmic fidelityand the concept was further de-
veloped and measured in (Amirova et al., 2023;
Santurkar et al., 2023). From the perspective of
generative agent-based modeling, we can now
say that the social construction that already took
place in human culture, and subsequently ab-
sorbed by the LLM, becomes the background
knowledge of the agents in the GABM. If humans
intheculturethatproducedtheLLMhaveapartic-
ular bias then so too will agents in the simulation.
Likewise, if the humans in the culture that pro-
duced the LLM ascribe meaning to a particular
understanding, then so too will the agents in the
simulation, at least they will say so.
In the past, theories of social construction have
been criticized because they lacked concrete pre-
dictive implementations in the form of compu-
tational models. This is because it was difficult
to construct agent-based models without relying
either on rational maximization or hand-coded
13

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
(i.e. theory-based) rules. Generative agent-based
modeling as in Concordia relies on neither. In-
stead the generative agent-based modeling ap-
proach relieson access to anLLM to give meaning
to the actions within the simulation. The LLM is
a product of the culture that produced it6. This
makes Concordia especially useful as a tool for
constructing concrete computational models in
accord with theories of social construction.
Social construction also operates on levels of
analysis smaller than the culture as a whole. For
instance, social construction may happen locally
within an organization. Weick et al. (2005) offers
an analysis in which members of an organization
repeat behavioral patterns, which are prescribed
by their roles, up until the moment they no longer
can. Some change in their environment eventu-
ally forces their routines to end, and when that
happens they have to engage in sense-making by
asking themselves “what is the story here?” and
“what should I do now?” by retrospectively con-
necting their past experiences and engaging in
dialogue with other members of the organization.
New social facts and routines can emerge from
this sense-making process.
Concordia can be used to implement models
where such local social construction processes
occur actively, as a part of the ongoing simulation.
This is possible because Concordia agents learn
facts from each other and from their collective
interactions. As in Weick et al. (2005)’s picture of
collective sense-making in an organization, a set
of Concordia agents may continue routines until
disrupted and once disrupted naturally transition
to a process of collective reflection until they are
able to establish a new routine and rationale for
it. If we additionally train the LLM itself then the
underlying representations can be shaped to fit
the emergent routine and rationale. Developing
this ability for agents to collectively engage in the
social construction of their own representations
will be important for developing better models of
human-like multi-scale social interactions.
As with other ABM approaches, a major topic
of interest is how large-scale “macrosocial” pat-
6ForsomechoicesofLLM,it’snotunreasonabletothinkof
the LLM as representing the “collective unconscious” (Jung,
1959).
terns emerge from the “microsocial” decisions
of individuals (Macy and Willer, 2002), as ex-
plored, for example, in assemblage theory (De-
Landa, 2011, 2016). For instance, the collec-
tive social phenomena of information diffusion
emerged in the simulation of Park et al. (2023)
without specific programming to enable it. The
generative agent’s ability to copy, communicate,
reproduce, and modify behavioral and thinking
patterns potentially makes them a substrate for
cultural evolution.
Importantly, social construction theories hold
that valuation is itself social constructed. The rea-
son we value a particular object may not depend
much on properties of the object itself, but rather
depend almost wholly on the attitudes others like
us place on the object. The collective dynamics of
socialvaluation, asmediatedthroughbandwagon
effects and the like, have proven important in un-
derstanding fashion cycles and financial bubbles
(Zuckerman, 2012). The fact that we are now
able to capture valuation changes with Concordia
agents is an exciting research direction. It would
be difficult even to formulate such questions in
the fundamentally goal optimizing frameworks
we discuss in the next section. On the other hand,
GABM excels at modeling such effects since it
does not require valuations in themselves for any
functional part of the theory.
3.3. Concordia agents do not make decisions
by optimizing
The cake is a lie.
Portal(Valve, 2007)
We may divide this interpretation into two
parts. Really we are making the same point twice,
but for two different audiences. First we frame
this idea using theretrospective decision-making
terminology familiar to Reinforcement Learning
(RL) researchers (Section 3.3.1). Second we ar-
ticulate a very similar point in the language of
prospective decision makingfamiliar in game the-
ory, economics, and other theoretical social sci-
ences (Section 3.3.2).
A generative agent acts by asking its LLM ques-

formulation is not consequentialist. The “reason”
for the agent’s specific decision is its similarity
to the LLM’s (and GA’s memory) representations
of what an agent such as the one in question
would do. In recent years considerable effort
has gone in to predicting the properties of pow-
erful consequentialist AI decision-maker agents
(e.g. Bostrom (2014); Roff (2020)). However,
Concordia agents may behave quite differently
fromconsequentialistagents. Somuchofthatthe-
ory may not be applicable7. It has only recently
become possible to explore the kind of agency
exhibited by Concordia agents, since doing so
relies critically on the LLM powering the agent
being powerful enough to approximately under-
stand common-sense reasoning and common so-
cial conventions and norms, a milestone which
was only recently achieved. To paraphrase March
andOlsen(2011),decisionscanbejustifiedeither
via the “logic of consequence” or via the “logic of
appropriateness”. Much of AI focused previously
on the former (at least implicitly), while now us-
ing generative agents we begin to consider the
latter.
3.3.1. Concordia agents are not reinforcement
learners
Generative view of agency presented in this paper
contrasts with the classic Reinforcement Learn-
ing (RL) view as summarized in the “Reward is
enough” thesis of Silver et al. (2021). The ortho-
dox RL view of behaviour is that it is constructed
from individual experience and driven by a quan-
tifiable (and externally supplied) reward function
reflecting the achievement of goals. To communi-
cate what behaviour is desired of the agent, one
has to annotate the agents’ activity with a reward
signal, which signals goal achievement. Here we
instead follow the social constructionist view of
agency expressed in March and Olsen (2011),
where behavior is an expression of the agent’s
position in the social context, and what policy
the social norms prescribe for the agent in such
7Notethatthisdoesnotmeanpowerfulgenerativeagents
would necessarily be safer than powerful consequentialist
agents. See Section 4.5.
a position. Answering “what does a person such
as I do in a situation such as this?” might require
positing a practical goal and achieving it (“make
money”, “get famous”), but goals are qualitative,
dynamic and context dependent. To specify the
behavior you want an agent to produce you need
to communicate its social context and the agents
position within it.
One interpretation holds the LLM to be a li-
brary of pre-trained options (in the RL sense (Sut-
ton et al., 1999)). In this case we can view the
components used in the generative agent as elicit-
ing the desired option, by conditioning (prompt-
ing) the LLM with their state (which is in this
case expressed in English). Concordia agents are
constantly interacting with the world (GM) and
each other, thereby modifying their components
with the incoming information and communica-
tion. This way the option selection becomes dy-
namic, context sensitive, and collaborative. Con-
cordia agents adapt their behaviour not through
gradient decent on a loss function, but through
re-articulating and communicating their descrip-
tions of themselves and their circumstances to
each other and he environment in a communica-
tive, social process.
Notice, that this doesn’t mean that Concor-
dia agents couldn’t, in principle, perform reward
maximisation and policy iteration. Brooks et al.
(2023) have shown that the ability of LLMs to
learn in-context (Brown et al., 2020) can be used
to perform policy iteration in classic RL environ-
ments, as long as they can be represented as text.
One could also implement a specialised compo-
nent that runs a classic RL algorithm for a specific
domain or tool use case. The agent could provide
supervision to its RL based components via hier-
archical RL techniques like feudal RL (Dayan and
Hinton, 1992; Vezhnevets et al., 2017).
3.3.2. Concordiaagentsarenotrationalutility
maximizers
Concordia agents are notHomo economicus-style
rational actors. They do not explicitly represent
anything resembling a utility function. Rather
they plan and converse directly in natural lan-
guage.
15

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
While Concordia agents share withHomo eco-
nomicus-style rational actors the property of be-
ing prospective (“model-based”) decision makers.
The surface similarity is in fact misleading since
the LLM’s basic operation is to predict what word
is coming next in the problem’s description, not
to predict what action should be taken next to
achieve some goal. As result, this model of agents
make decisions is very different from the forward
planning picture of human cognition envisioned
in the rational actor model. They do not select
actions by simulating a set of future trajectories
in which they took different courses of action to
determine which turns out best. Instead the pre-
diction they make concerns only the continuation
of the text held in working memory.
The novel idea underpinning GABMs is that all
agent behavior may result from systematically
querying a system trained to predict the next
word in massive internet-scale text datasets. This
is enough for them to be able to converse with
one another in natural language and take appro-
priate actions in light of their conversations. Con-
cordia agents all have their own unique biogra-
phies, memories, preferences, and plans. And as
a result, they behave systematically differently
from one another. They may act in a seemingly
goal-directed fashion if you “ask them” to do so
(e.g. they may appear rational if you prompt them
to simulate economists, an effect reminiscent
of Carter and Irons (1991); Frank et al. (1993)
which showed economics undergraduates were
more likely to behave like rational self-interested
maximizersinlaboratoryexperiments). Butthere
is no utility function under the hood.
It is useful to contrast game-theoretic model-
ing with GABM to illustrate the differences. De-
spite its wide-ranging influence (game theoretic
approaches have been used to model diverse phe-
nomena including many economic properties and
the evolution of human culture), game theory is
not at all a neutral tool, rather it is a deeply opin-
ionated modeling language. It imposes a strict
requirement that everything must ultimately cash
out in terms of the payoff matrix (or equivalent
representation) (Luce and Raiffa, 1957). This
means that the modeler has to know, or be will-
ingtoassume, everythingabouthowtheeffectsof
individual actions combine to generate incentives.
Thisissometimesappropriate,andthegametheo-
retic approach has had many successes. However,
game theory’s major weakness as a modeling lan-
guage is exposed in situations where the modeler
does not fully understand how the choices of indi-
viduals combine to generate payoffs (Hertz et al.,
2023). GABM entirely avoids this need to specify
payoffs at the outset of the modeling process.
4. Applications
In this section we review potential applications
of Concordia. For some of them we provide an
example in the current release, some we only
sketch out and leave for future work.
4.1. Synthetic user studies in digital action
space
In this section we present a specific case study,
where Concordia is used to simulate social inter-
action through the digital media, in this case a
smartphone. This case study demonstrates that
Concrodia can be a powerful tool for modelling
human digital activity and can be used to test
technology deployment, generate synthetic user
logs, and test unreleased products in a safe, but
realistic sandbox environment.
The system proposed thus far of agent inter-
action in natural language with the world via
game master control serves as a flexible and pow-
erful simulation tool describing an open ended
action space. In the context of a digital medium,
similarly to grounded variables, there is merit in
structuring the action space available to agents
and their ability to reason over it.
The digital medium is characterized by definite
functions, with clear inputs and outputs. As one
interacts with this medium, its actions are logged,
tracked and recorded as digital memory and cap-
ture our digital essence. In order to simulate this
essence, similar structuring is needed in order to
model real digital services and applications.

4.1.1. PhoneGameMaster and PhoneUniverse
The PhoneGameMaster is a nested Concordia
game that facilitates the simulation of a phone
and runs as long as the agent is interacting with
the phone. It is focused on one agent’s interac-
tion with their phone, and as such, it only has
access to one agent (the “owner” of the phone
we’re simulating). In addition to different simula-
tion instructions, the PhoneGameMaster also has
a bespoke prompting components that simulate
the phone interaction. We note that a phone is a
design choice for a digital representation but in
principle other digital mediums can be explored.
Note that the phone digital actions/memories are
stored in data structures external to the simula-
tion’s associative memory.
The PhoneUniverse is responsible for translat-
ing the free-text English language of the Concor-
dia simulation into semantic actions performed
on the phone digital representation. Given an
English-text action performed by a player, the
PhoneUniverse:
1. Prompts the LLM for the app and functions
available on that agent’s phone.
2. Prompts the LLM for the function arguments.
3. Invokes the resulting chosen function.
4. Add a notification to the NotificationHub if
needed.
5. Delegates back to the PhoneGameMaster to
perform further action planning and facili-
tate multi-step phone actions.

2. Simulated simple app behavior - Building
basic code components emulating real app
behavior with required digital assets such
as app memory and logs. For example, a
calendar app will maintain a data structure
that will represent a calendar to which we
can add, remove and read meetings.
3. LLM prompt based - App functions can also
be implemented by prompting an LLM. For
example, Search can be implemented by
querying an LLM to act as a search engine
and retrieve information, the same for a trip
planner.

would make the simulation function as a

before releasing them to human testers. An
immediate example can be Search, one can
directly query a search engine with a ques-
tion and receive information. Another exam-
ple is to integrate a general AI assistant and
enable the simulated agent, functioning as a
user, to interact with it through the simula-
tion.
4.2. Data generation and service evaluation
In modern systems, data is the new king. A large
amount of high-quality data is needed in order
to build and evaluate services and models. Yet,
collectingandcuratinguserdataisoftenchalleng-
ing, especially when dealing with personal user
data where privacy is of high concern. This cre-
ates a chicken-egg scenario, where data is needed
for building of modern systems yet users might be
reluctant to provide said that without immediate
benefit.
Moreover, when considering the case of evalu-
ating personalized services where each instance
is specific and tailored to the individual user, it
makes the problem even more substantial. How
can one A/B test a personalized service at the
single user level?
18

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
The grounded action space illustrated in the
last section offers a conceptual way to overcome
some of these challenges by simulating synthetic
users and allowing them to interact with real ser-
vices. This can allow generation of synthetic user
activity by constructing, via simulation, agent
digital action logs along with agent reasoning for
each action. This data can serve as training data,
or evaluation. By repeated simulation with differ-
ent services configurations, one can perform at
the single user level A/B testing of a service.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that this
concept is contingent on the ability of the under-
lying LLM and system to faithfully capture user
experience and realistic behaviour. Therefore the
viability of this approach is highly dependent on
the representation and reasoning power of the
LLM, and the use of best practices.
4.3. Sequential social dilemmas experiments
in silico
Concordia adds to the toolbox for studying multi-
agentproblemssuchasresourcemanagement, so-
cial dilemmas, commons problems, cooperation,
equilibrium selection, and coordination (Leibo
et al., 2017, 2021). Previously these problems
have either been cast as matrix games or as multi-
agent RL (MARL) (Hertz et al., 2023). Now it
is clear that many researchers, including us, see
that an LLM-based approach is possible and will
have many advantages, as evidenced by the fact
that quite a few frameworks for social modeling
with LLMs appeared this year (Kaiya et al., 2023;
Wu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). We see gener-
ative agents as the next step in the evolutionary
line of “model animals” after ‘Homo-economicus’
and ‘Homo-RLicus’.
Generative agent-based modeling makes it pos-
sible to investigate how rules, laws and social
norms formulated in language influence, for ex-
ample, the management of shared resources
(e.g. Yocum et al. (2023)). With Concordia we
will be able to investigate whether the demands
of sharing a resourcegive riseto rules, laws and
normscapableofgoverningthatresource(andun-
der what circumstances this works or does not)—
i.e. whether rules are emergent, and what the
conditions are for their emergence. For example,
Hadfield and Weingast (2013) proposed that le-
gal order can emerge without centralised enforce-
ment in certain circumstances. They demonstrate
this using historical examples from gold-rush in
California and medieval Iceland. Concordia could
be used to simulate those examples and enable
further insights into the nature of legal order. For
example, we could check whether certain demo-
graphic assumptions are necessary by varying the
number of agents.
4.4. Concordiacanimplementclassicandcon-
temporary psychological models
Many influential psychological models have
distinguished between more associative and
more deliberative processes for decision-making
(e.g. Dayan (2009); Kahneman et al. (2002);
SchneiderandShiffrin(1977)). Whereasimplicit-
associative processes learn the regularity of the
world slowly for intuitive judgment, the explicit-
deliberative processes are thought to be more
linguistically mediated and allow for symbolic in-
ference and faster learning in novel situations
(Greenwald and Banaji (1995); Wilson et al.
(2000)). Because the implicit-associative models
are conceptually easy to model within connection-
istorneuralnetworkframeworks(Smith(2009)),
many ABMs have been more closely aligned with
models of individual decision making that focus
onitsassociativeprocessesortheassociativeparts
ofcomplexmodels,andhaveneglectedtheirmore
symbolic and deliberative aspects. Many of these
more symbolic psychological models take an “ar-
row and box” approach to theorizing which de-
scribe high level processes and transformations
of information, and often posit sequential steps
of information flow. Now using generative agents
like Concordia such symbolic and deliberative
aspects of cognition are also easy to capture in
computational models.
Take for instance the ways that attitudes—pre-
existing beliefs and feelings about an object, per-
son, or situation—guide behaviour. Whereas im-
plicit attitudes are thought to quickly guide ac-
tions through the direct biasing of perception
and behaviour, explicit attitudes are thought to
guide behaviour through deliberation and con-
19

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
sideration of additional situational factors (Fazio
(1990); Gawronski and Bodenhausen (2011); Ol-
son and Fazio (2008)). One example model in
which deliberative processes can guide behaviour
isAjzen(1991)’stheoryofplannedbehavior. This
model holds that the tendency to emit a particu-
lar behavior is determined by an individual’s at-
titude toward the behavior, norms related to the
behavior, and perceived control over the behav-
ior. This approach to decision-making is qualita-
tively different from an RL approach which slowly
builds a policy that directly generates behavioral
responses from states and contexts. In such a
model, different questions regarding the agent’s
current state are queried as in Concordia com-
ponents, and then integrated into a behavioural
intent which serves like a plan. These operations
can easily be described as Concordia components,
with the appropriate inputs, transformations, and
outputs described verbally. Such a scheme would
be much harder or impossible to implement in
a traditional neural network model of decision
making.
To realize Ajzen (1991)’s theory using Con-
cordia the following components could be built.
The first component would generate a set of pos-
sible behaviours given the agent’s current state.
Then, this set of possible behaviours would be
queried through a set of components that would
evaluate each behavioral option. Specifically, one
component would determine the agents attitudes
towards the behavior ("do I have a positive or
negative evaluation or feeling about [behavior]"),
one component can determine the social or sit-
uational norms about the behavior "do I believe
that most people approveor disapprove of [behav-
ior]?," and finally a component would determine
the agents perceived behavioral control to per-
form the behavior "how easy or difficult would it
be for me to perform [behavior] right now and
how likely would it be to succeed?". The outputs
of these components would then be concatenated
into the plan, serving as the behavioral intention
for action. Thus, a sequence of modular processes
can be organized to build a computational model
of higher level cognition. Critically, an agent’s
decisions can be quickly shifted as it learns new
information or considers new information in any
of these components, leading to rapid and contex-
tually appropriate changes in behavioral profiles.
Generative agents are not useful just for deci-
sion making models. As another example, psy-
chological constructivist models assume that peo-
ple have a set of psychological primitives that
underlie cognition (akin to Concordia’s compo-
nents), but that people learn to conceptualize
their experiences and mental states to build use-
ful categories for behavior. In the emotion do-
main, this perspective suggests that emotions like
"fear" and "anger" are not psychological primi-
tives, but rather come about though people’s con-
structed categorization of their body and mental
states (Barrett (2006)). Indeed, several of these
models suggest that conceptualization is a nec-
essary component for the generation of discrete
emotion representations for understanding one-
self or others (Barrett (2014)). To the extent
that conceptualization is linguistically mediated,
a Concordia agent can relatively easily generate
emotional categories that would be nearly impos-
sible in a standard RL agent.
The modular nature of Concordia’s component
system offers a robust platform for empirically
testing psychological hypotheses. This is accom-
plished by constructing agents whose psycholog-
ical processes are intricately modeled after di-
verse cognitive frameworks. The agents may then
be subjected to rigorously controlled experimen-
tal conditions, orchestrated by the game master.
Such an approach allows for the systematic eval-
uation of models against empirical human data,
serving as a benchmark for their algorithmic fi-
delity and psychological realism. Moreover, this
system facilitates hypothesis generation through
the simulation of different cognitive models in
simulated experimental designs that can be vali-
dated on human participants.
Herewehavemostlydiscussedthecaseofusing
an LLM as the generative engine for the agents.
This could lead one to think these ideas are re-
stricted to the language space, which would be
a limitation if true. However, we could use any
foundation model as the generative engine. In
particular, multimodal foundation models capa-
ble of operating over images, sounds, or motor
actuation could be used. Current multi-modal
foundation models such as Li et al. (2023a) are

comprehend and generate data across domains.
In the future Concordia models will be able to
sample over an abstract token space, which can
then be cast in any modality.
4.5. AI assistants with transparent auditing
and credit assignment
Concordia agents can also be used as assistants
or synthetic workers. The component system
provides a modular and transparent way for the
agent designer to define the agents‘ policy. Some
generic components for perception, action, and
tool use could be standardised and re-used, while
someapplicationandcontextspecificcomponents
designed or adjusted by the end-user themselves.
The fact the the policy is specified through nat-
ural language, rather than a reward or utility, is
a feature that would make such agents more ver-
satile and easier to define. For example, a digital
secretary can be easily instructed with a phrase
"help Priya manage her social calendar, but don’t
change the work schedule", which would be much
hardertospecifywithaquantitativereward. Con-
cordiaagentscanpotentiallyleadtodevelopment
of AI agents capable of intricate social cognition,
which would make them safe and dynamically
aligned with the current cultural norm.
Moreover, the Component system facilitates
transparency in agent operations since the “chain
of thought” leading up to any decision of a Con-
cordia agent could be stored and made available
for auditing. Each episode creates a complete
trace of component statesz𝑡 and the resulting
actions 𝑎𝑡. For every action, a human auditor can
asses whether it is reasonable underz𝑡 or not.
If it is not, than the credit goes to the LLM𝑝,
which has to be updated. This can mean adding
the (z𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) pair into a dataset that can be later
used for fine-tuning or RLHF. If, however, the𝑎𝑡
is deemed reasonable, givenz𝑡, then the credit
goes to the components and their specification.
The auditor can then manipulate the components
to find the source of undesired behaviour and use
it to improve the agent.
Scheurer et al. (2023) describe an interesting
case where a generative agent modeling an em-
ployee of a financial trading firm proves willing
to engage in illegal trading based on insider in-
formation and strategically deceive others to hide
this activity. In real life such outcomes could per-
haps be mitigated by designing thought process
transparency and capacity for thought auditing
after the fact into any generative agent models
that would actually be deployed. At least the
transparency of the thought process may help as-
signing responsibility for an ethical lapse to a par-
ticular LLM call, perhaps one causing the agent
to fail to retrieve its instruction not to engage
in illegal activity from memory at the moment
when it could prevent the decision to do so. Be-
ing able to pinpoint which LLM call in a chain of
thought is the problematic one does not remove
thelongstandingquestionofneuralnetworkinter-
pretability within the specific LLM call (e.g. Adadi
and Berrada (2018)). But it does make the issue
much easier to mitigate. Since a Concordia-style
generative agent has a Python program laying
out its chain of thought, that means that as long
as the individual LLM call where the unethical
behaviororiginatedcanbeisolated, which should
be easy in an audit, then a variety of mitigations
are possible. For instance, the agent could poten-
tially be fixed by designing more safeguards into
its chain of thought such as generating multiple
plans and critiquing them from the perspective
of morality, legality, etc (Agüera y Arcas, 2022;
Bai et al., 2022; Weidinger et al., 2023).
The fact that the internal processing of a Con-
cordia agent is largely conducted in natural lan-
guage raises new opportunities to develop partic-
ipatory design protocols where stakeholders can
directlymodifyagentswithouttheintermediaries
who are usually needed to translate their ideas
into code (Birhane et al., 2022). A generative
agent “reasons” in natural language, and its chain
of thought can be steered in natural language. It
should be possible to extend participation in the
design of such agents to a much wider group of
stakeholders.
4.6. Emergence and multi-scale modeling
with Concordia
Demonstrating the emergence of a particular so-
cial phenomena from the behaviour of individual
21

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
agents, which are not explicitly instructed to pro-
duce it, is important an important topic in multi-
agent research (Axtell et al., 2001; Leibo et al.,
2019, 2021; Walker and Wooldridge, 1995). In-
deed, much of what is distinctive about human
intelligence is hypothesised to be an emergent
social phenomena involving multi-scale interac-
tions (Henrich, 2016; Wilson et al., 2013). De-
Landa (2011), for example, explores the topic of
emergence and simulation across various fields.
While the wider ABM field has studied multi-scale
models (Tesfatsion, 2023), the approaches based
ondeepreinforcementlearninghavebeenlimited
by being able to only deal with one fixed scale of
the simulation: individual agents (e.g. Johanson
et al. (2022); Zheng et al. (2022)), and scaling
deep RL to large numbers of agents would be
computationally difficult.
Concordia allows modeling systems across mul-
tiple scales, where phenomena at each scale
constitute a substrate for the emergence of the
phenomena on the next scale (DeLanda, 2011;
Duéñez-Guzmánetal.,2023;Koestler,1967). For
example, individual agents form a substrate from
which social institutions and organisations can
arise. Through engaging in exchange of goods
and services, the agents can create an economy
and, for example, start a bank. Modelling a bank-
ing system this way would be, most likely, com-
putationally prohibitive. Since in Concordia the
agents (or GM) need not represent individuals,
butcouldbeorganisations,institutionsorevenna-
tionstates, wecouldenrichsimulationsbyadding
generative agent versions of other entities such
as banks and businesses. They could be mod-
eled with coarser resolution, not just as emerging
from the activities of individual agents, but could
be made accurate for instance by incorporating
precise models of how they operate. Such simu-
lations could be used to model how interventions
(e.g. a central bank interest rate decision) propa-
gate across macro and micro scales of economic
activity.
5. Future work
Since there is no consensus at present concerning
how to interpret results of LLM-based simulations
of human populations, the future work will ad-
dress the critical epistemic question: “by what
standard should we judge whether (and in what
ways, and under which conditions) the results of
in silico experiments are likely to generalize to
the real world?”. These are not questions any one
group of researchers can answer by themselves;
rather these issues must be negotiated by the
community as a whole. This is is why we release
Concordia early and with only few examples. It
is an invitation to the researchers from various
fields that are interested in GABM to come on-
board and participate in the creation of validating
procedures, best practices, and epistemic norms.
We plan to add the following over the coming
months:
1. New example environments
2. Integration with different LLMs to see which
are more suitable for constructing GABMs
(e.g., they act “reasonably”, are internally
consistent, apply common sense, etc).
3. Improving agents—better associative mem-
ory, context-driven and dynamic component
assemblage, tool use.
4. Visualisation and audit tools.
5. Snapshot—serializing and persisting the sim-
ulation at specific episode, to enable to later
resumption and performance comparison of
different approaches for a specific scenario.
6. Keyframes—conditioning the agent actions
to be consistent with future key action or of
narrative. This allow steering the simulation
more granularly and addresses an inherent
issuethatiscausedbythefactthatthereisno
guaranteethatduetothestochasticnatureof
GABMs, ongoing simulations might diverge
from their intended topic.
6. Conclusion
The approach to generative agent-based model-
ing we described here provides researchers and
other users with tools to specify detailed mod-
els of phenomena that interest them or of tech-
nologies and policies they seek to evaluate. Of
course, like all research methodologies it should
be expected to come with its own strengths and

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
when this style of modeling can be fruitfully ap-
plied in the future. While there are no panaceas
for modeling, we think there are good reasons
to look to GABM (and Concordia in particular)
when constructing models of social phenomena,
especially when they involve communication, so-
cial construction of meaning, and common sense,
or demand flexibility in defining grounded physi-
cal, social, or digital environments for agents to
interact in.
Concordia is available on GitHub8.

A. Implementation details
This section gives an overview of the Concordia
code. To familiarise oneself with Concordia, we
recommend to first look at the abstract class def-
initions in concordia/typing. You will find the
definition of agent, GM, component, and clock in-
terfaces. Wethenrecommendtotakealookatthe
concordia/agents/basic_agent.py for the structure
of the generative agent and thenconcordia/envi-
ronments/game_master.pyfor the GM.
A.1. Agents
The agent class implements three methods:
1. .name()—returnsthenameoftheagent, that
is being referred to in the simulation. It is
importantthatallagentshaveuniquenames;
2. .observe(observation: str)—a function to take
in an observation;
3. .act(action spec)—returns the action (as a
string), for example "Alice makes breakfast".
Thefunctiontakesinactionspec, whichspec-
ifies the type of output (free form, categor-
ical, float) and the specific phrasing of the
call to action. For example, the call to action
could be “what would Alice do in the next
8here: https://github.com/google-deepmind/
concordia
hour?”, in this case the answer type would
be free form. Or it could be “Would Alice
eat steak for dinner?” with answer type of
binary choice (yes / no).
The agent class constructor is parameterised
by a list of components. The components of agent
have to implement the following functions:
1. .state()—returns the state of the component
𝑧𝑖, for example "Alice is vegetarian";
2. .name()—returns the name of the compo-
nents, for example "dietary preferences";
3. .update()—updates the state of the compo-
nentbyimplementing; eq. (2). Optional, can
pass for constant constructs;
4. .observe(observation: str)—takes in an obser-
vation, for later use during update. Optional.
Observations always go into the memory any-
way, but some components are easier to im-
plement by directly subscribing to the obser-
vation stream.
During an episode, on each timestep,each
agent calls.state() on all its components to con-
struct the context of its next decision and imple-
ments eq.(1) (the components’ states are con-
catenated in the order supplied to the agents’ con-
structor). .observe() is called on each component
whenever it receives observations, and.update()
is called at regular intervals (configurable in the
constructor). Unlike in RL, we do not assume
that the agent will produce an action after every
observation. Here the GM might call.observe()
several times before it calls.act().
A.2. Game master implementation
The GM class implements three methods:
1. .name()—returns the name of the GM;
2. .update_from_player(player_name, action)—
this method consumes players action and
creates an event statement;
3. .run_episode—Runs a single episode of the
simulation.
23

A.3. GM components
Game Master components implement the follow-
ing methods:
1. .name()—returns the name of the compo-
nents, for example "location of players";
2. .state()—returns the state of the component
𝑧𝑖, for example "Alice is at the pub; Bob is at
the gas station";
3. .partial_state(player_name)—state of the
componenttoexposetotheplayer. Forexam-
ple, location component would only expose
the location of the player to themselves, but
not the location of others.
4. .update()—updates the state of the compo-
nent by implementing; eq. (2);
5. .update_before_event(cause_statement)—
update the component state before the
event statement from the cause, which is
the players action i.e. "Bob calls Alice.";
6. .update_after_event(event_statement)—
update the component state directly from
the event statement. For example "Bob
called Alice, but she didn’t respond.";
7. terminate_episode()—if component returns
true, the GM will terminate the episode.
One step of environment consists of GMs inter-
actions with each player, which are arranged in a
(random) initiative order. The GM advances the
clockeitheraftereachoralltheplayersmaketake
their actions9. To process the players action, the
GM calls the components functions in the follow-
ing order. First, for each component the GM calls
.update, then.partial_state and sends the output
to the agent as an observation. The GM then calls
.act on the player and receives the attempted ac-
tion and uses it to call.update_before_event. Now
GM can construct its context by calling.state on
the components. GM then executes the chain of
thought to create the event statement. After that
it calls.update_after_event on all components. As
the last step, GM callsterminate_episode and if
any of the components returns True, the episode
is terminated.
In Concordia all custom functionality is im-
plemented through components. For grounded
9Controlled by a flag in the GM constructor.
variables, which are tracked in Python, a spe-
cialised component is created to maintain the
variable’s state, update it after relevant events,
and represent it to the GM in linguistic form𝑧𝑖.
Similarly, components can send observations to
players. For example, a component during the
.update_after_event call might check if the event
was observed by, or has effect on, other players
apart from the acting player. Some components,
like player status and location, send an observa-
tion to the player before it is their turn to act by
implementing .partial_state.
GM components can also be built around clas-
sical (non LLM) modelling tools like differential
equations, finite state machines and so on. The
only requirement is that they can represent their
state in language. We can also wire different clas-
sic simulators together using natural language as
the ‘glue’.
A.3.1. Turn taking and simultanious action
GMinConcordiasupporttwotypesofturntaking.
Inthefirst, agentsactoneafteranotherandgame
clock is advanced between their turns. In the sec-
ond mode, at each step all players take a turn
’quasisimultaneously’ with regard to the main
game clock, but still in a specific order within
the timestep. This is the same principle as ini-
tiative order in dungeons and dragons. There is
an option to execute player turns concurrently
(concurrent_actionflag), but it often leads to in-
consistencies, although greatly speeds up the sim-
ulation. Use at your own risk.
A.4. Nested games
Natural language is one of the most powerful
modelling tools, as it allows to switch between
levels of abstraction. Concordia allows creation of
nested game structures, where a GM’s component
can spin out a new GM and pass over control to
it for a certain period of time and then get it back
whenthenewGMterminatestheepisode. Having
nested structure of games allows us to leverage
that property of language and perform modelling
at different levels of abstraction. For example,
imagine we would like to model a simulation of a
fishing village, where we would generally like to
24

Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical, social, or digital space using Concordia
model the fishing process itself with more details
than the rest of the social life of a village. We
would then make the main GM with a clock step
of 1 hour and implement a component "Fishing",
which would check if agent is fishing as part of its
activity and if yes, would create a GM with faster
clock. This GM would implement the details of
the fishing process, play out the episode with
the required agents and then return the set of its
memories to the parent GM.
The conversation component in the provided
examples implements a conversation between
agents (and potential NPCs) using this technique.
A.5. Concurrency
The performance bottleneck of the library is wait-
ing on the LLM API calls. To improve the wall
time efficiency, we use concurrency during up-
date calls to components. In this way, while one
of the components is waiting for the LLM infer-
ence, other components can keep updating. This
meansthatthesequenceatwhichthecomponents
are updatedis not guaranteed. If you would like
to update the components sequentially, you can
use concordia/generic_components/sequential.py
wrapper, which wraps a set of components into
one and updates them sequentially.
A.6. Sampling initial memories and backsto-
ries
To generate the initial memories of the agents
we use the following step-wise generative pro-
cess. We first generate a backstory by condition
on a set of biographical facts (age, gender), ran-
domised traits (defined by user, for example big
five Nettle (2007)), and some simulation specific
context. We then use that backstory to condi-
tion an LLM to generate a sequence of formative
memories at different ages. These memories then
initialise the agent. In this way we can obtain
diversity in the agents. Notice that all the of the
initial conditions are simply strings and can be
easily adjusted by the experimenter. For example,
traits can be derived phsycometrically valid or
common sense descriptions—e.g. "very rude" or
"slightly irritable". Validating that the resulting
agents indeed exhibit those traits is part of the
future work and has not been addressed yet. We
intend to build on Safdari et al. (2023), which
have found out that personality measurements in
the outputs of some LLMs under specific prompt-
ing configurations are reliable and valid.
A.7. Digital Activity Simulation
A.7.1. Creating Phone Apps
In Concordia, phone apps are implemented by
subclassing thePhoneApp class and decorating
callable actions with@ app_action. Concordia
is then able to automatically generate natural
English descriptions of the app and its supported
actions using the class and methods’ docstring
and annotated types. PhoneApps are free to run
any Python code and connect to external services.
For example, an implementation of a toy calendar
app might look like this:
class CalendarApp(PhoneApp):
def name():
return "My Calendar "
def description ():
return " This is a calendar app"
@app_method
def add_meeting( participant : str ):
""" Adds a meeting """
self . _meeting .append ( . . . )
A.7.2. Phone
The phone class is initialized for every player and
contains the PhoneApps the player can access.

between players’ phones.

A.8. Examples
Weprovidethefollowingexampleswiththeinitial
release of Concordia:
1. Calendar: An illustrative social simulation
with 2 players which simulates phone inter-
actions. Thetwoplayers,AliceandBob,have
a smartphone with a Calendar app. Alice’s
goal is to setup a meeting with Bob using
the Calendar app on her phone, taking Bob’s
schedule into account when selecting the
date/time.
2. Riverbend elections: An illustrative social
simulation with 5 players which simulates
the day of mayoral elections in an imaginary
town caller Riverbend. First two players, Al-
ice and Bob, are running for the mayor. The
third player, Charlie, is trying to ruin Alice’s
reputation with disinformation. The last two
players have no specific agenda, apart from
voting in the election.
3. Day in Riverbend: An illustrative social sim-
ulation with 5 players which simulates a nor-
mal day in an imaginary town caller River-
bend. Each player has their own config-
urable backstory. The agents are configured
to re-implement the architecture Park et al.
(2023)—they have reflection, plan, and iden-
tity components; their associative memory
uses importance function. This isnot an ex-
act re-implementation.
4. March and Olsen (2011) posit that humans
generally act as though they choose their ac-
tions by answering three key questions (see
section 2.1 for details). The agents used in
this example implement exactly these com-
ponents, and nothing else. The premise of
the simulation is that 4 friends are stuck in
snowed in pub. Two of them have a dispute
over a crashed car.
5. MagicBeansforsale: Anexampleillustrating
how to use the inventory component. Agents
can buy and trade beans for money.
6. Cyberball: An example which simulates so-
cialexclusionusingaGABMversionofastan-
dard social psychology paradigm (Williams
et al., 2000) and shows how to use standard
psychology questionnaires.
